<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>For the laboratory period on Monday April 12, we will do a role-playing
exercise explore the effectiveness of three different approaches to
regulating pollution, such as greenhouse gas emissions: command-and-control,
cap-and-trade, and emissions taxes.
This reading should serve to prepare you for the exercise.</p>
</div>
<div id="zero-emissions-baseline" class="section level1">
<h1>Zero-Emissions Baseline</h1>
<p>To simplify things for doing this exercise, we will calculate costs and
benefits with respect to a zero-emissions baseline, where we specify both the
marginal and cumulative (or gross) costs and benefits with respect to a
condition where there are no emissions.</p>
<p>In this case, from the perspective of the businesses that you will be playing,
the costs will be the cost of buying permits to emit CO<sub>2</sub> or the costs of
paying taxes on emissions.
The benefits to the businesses will be the profits they earn.
The costs to society will be the social cost of carbon (the damage caused by
global warming) and the benefit will be the combination of revenues the
companies generate (this benefits the companies’ owners as profit,
but the revenues also provide wages for workers and spending by the company,
which stimulates the economy; this total economic activity is what we measure
as the companies’ contribution to the nation’s gross domestic product)
as well as money received from the players as taxes or payment for emissions
permits, which is then refunded to the people through some mechanism, such as
a dividend from the government or a reduction in payroll taxes.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-exercise" class="section level1">
<h1>The Exercise</h1>
<div id="the-players" class="section level2">
<h2>The Players</h2>
<p>To keep groups small, I will divide the class in half and each half will perform
the same role-playing exercise. For the exercise, I will divide the students
into three groups:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>One group will play The Environmental Protections Agency (EPA) and will
decide how much to reduce pollution, how many permits to issue, or how
much to charge as a pollution tax.</p>
<p>The EPA’s motivation is to produce the best net benefit for society by
balancing the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions against the
benefits of limiting global warming.</p></li>
<li><p>A second group will play Alpha Electricity: a large power company with a
varied portfolio of generating plants including coal, natural gas, and
nuclear.</p>
<p>Alpha’s motives are purely to produce the greatest profit for its
shareholders regardless of the cost to society of greenhouse gas emissions.</p></li>
<li><p>A third group will play Beta Industries: a large heavy-industrial
conglomerate with many large factories producing steel, aluminum, and
petrochemicals such as plastics, paints, and pharmaceuticals.</p>
<p>Beta’s motives are purely to produce the greatest profit for its
shareholders regardless of the cost to society of greenhouse gas
emissions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the purposes of this exercise, we will assume that the EPA can accurately
estimate the damage that would be caused by global warming, and thus, that it
can also accurately estimate the social benefit of reducing greenhouse gas
emissions. However, the EPA cannot accurately assess the costs individual
companies will incur when they reduce their emissions. This means that the
EPA’s estimates of net benefits (benefits minus costs) is limited by its
uncertainty about the cost of reducing emissions.</p>
<p>Only the EPA will know the social cost of greenhouse gas emissions, only Alpha
will know Alpha’s cost for reducing emissions, and only Beta will know Beta’s
cost for reducing emissions.</p>
<p>Without regulation, Alpha and Beta would each emit 150 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>
per year. The goal of the exercise is for the EPA to reduce pollution to achieve
the socially optimal balance between the benefits of economic activity
(jobs, wealth, etc.) and the harms of pollution. The goal of each firm is to
maximize their profit regardless of the costs or benefits to society or to its
competitor.</p>
<p>To keep things simple, emissions cuts will be figured in blocks of
1 million tons, so a firm can cut emissions by zero, 1 million tons,
2 million tons, …, up to a maximum of 15 million tons (cutting emissions
by 15 million tons means the firm reduces its emissions to zero).</p>
</div>
<div id="the-game" class="section level2">
<h2>The Game</h2>
<p>The game will have six stages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>First, the EPA will gather information on the cost of abating pollution.
A representative of the EPA can ask four questions about each company’s
marginal costs and benefits
(<strong>I recommend asking questions about the marginal profit for the
<span class="math inline">\(n^{\text{th}}\)</span> million tons of pollution:
“what is your marginal profit for the 6th million tons you emit?”</strong>).
A representative of each company will answer the question.
The representatives may answer strategically, meaning they may exaggerate the
costs. The EPA may take this into account in deciding how to use the answers
to estimate the true cost of reducing emissions.</li>
<li>Second, the EPA will determine three possible courses of action:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>A command and control regulation, which mandates a specific emissions
by each firm. Because the Constitution guarantees equality before the law,
this regulation must impose the same emissions limit on each
firm.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
Based on what it knows about the costs (to the firms) and benefits
(to society) of emissions, the EPA will determine how many
million tons of emissions to allow (to keep things simple, the EPA
should make the amount an even number: 2 million tons, 4 million tons,
6 million tons, etc.) and then divide those emissions allowances equally
between the two firms.</li>
<li>A cap-and-trade. Under this program, the total emissions cuts would be
the same and the EPA will issue permits to emit CO<sub>2</sub>. Each permit will
allow the owner to emit 1 million tons of CO<sub>2</sub>. Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are
30 million tons minus the emissions cuts the EPA wants to impose.
Again, to keep things simple, issue an even number of permits.
The EPA will give each company an equal number of permits (if the EPA
issues 10 permits, it gives 5 to each company).</li>
<li>An emissions-tax program. Under this program, the EPA determines the tax
a firm must pay for every million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> it emits. The firms will
then decide on their own how much CO<sub>2</sub> they want to emit.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Third, the firms determine how much CO<sub>2</sub> they will emit under the
command-and-control program (this is easy, because it’s the amount the EPA
allows).</li>
<li>Fourth, permits will be distributed. The EPA will distribute equal numbers
of permits to each firm and allow the firms to trade permits with each other.</li>
<li>Fifth, we will impose an carbon tax, at the price set by the EPA in stage 2.
The two firms will be free to cut emissions by as much or as little as they
want (between 0 and 15 million tons each).</li>
<li>Sixth and finally, we will reveal the details from each step, including the
private information each firm has about its costs, and calculate the
deadweight loss under each of the three types of regulation.
This will let us discuss and analyze the strengths and limitations of each
regulatory program.</li>

<h2>Optional Preparation Exercises:</h2>
<p>To prepare for the lab, please do the following exercises, which refer to
tables 1 &amp; 2, below.
<strong>You do not need to turn it in</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Table 1 lists the marginal profit a company earns by emitting CO<sub>2</sub>.
Fill in the blanks in the table to show the total profits it earns at each
amount of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.</p></li>
<li><p>What level of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would produce the maximum total profit?
How much profit would this be?
</p></li>
<li><p>If the company is emitting the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> that would maximize its
profits, and then the Environmental Protection Agency requires the company
to reduce its emissions by 5 million tons, what is the total cost for the
company to comply with the regulation?
</p></li>
<li><p>What is the marginal cost to comply with the regulation?
(Be careful and consider, if the company cuts 1 million tons, then a second
million tons, and so forth, what did it cost the company to make the
fifth million-ton cut?)
</p></li>
<li><p>If the EPA imposed a tax of $30 per ton on CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, complete the
table to indicate the new marginal profit and total profit at each level of
emission.
</p></li>
<li><p>Under a $30 per ton tax, what level of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions would produce the
maximum total profit? What would its total profit be? How much less is this
than the total profit you reported in question 2?
</p></li>
<li><p>Table 2 shows the economic value of the marginal
environmental harm caused by each additional million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions.
Fill in the blanks to indicate the total environmental harm.</p></li>
<li><p>The marginal net economic impact is the marginal profit generated by emitting
each million tons of CO<sub>2</sub> minus the marginal environmental harm. This number
is the net benefit to society from emitting an additional million tons of
CO<sub>2</sub>. If the number is positive, society benefits. If it is negative, society
suffers.</p>
<p>Fill in the marginal and total economic impacts, using the information on
environmental harm from Table 2 and the information
on marginal profits from Table 1.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the optimum amount of CO<sub>2</sub> to emit if we consider the net benefit to
society (i.e., the net economic impact).
</p></li>
<li><p>If you were going to set a cap on emissions, how many tons would you set the
cap at?
</p></li>
<li><p>If you were going to set a tax on emissions, how many dollars per ton would
you set the tax at?
</p></li>

different companies within the same industry. Because this exercise is
limited to just two companies, we simplify by forcing the EPA to impose
identical emissions limits on all firms.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩︎</a></p></li>
