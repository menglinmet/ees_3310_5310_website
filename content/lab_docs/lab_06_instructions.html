<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>You have done several structured labs that provided opportunities to learn
about R, RMarkdown, and several different aspects of climate science (data
analysis and several computer models).
For the next few weeks, you will have a chance to utilize the skills you have
learned thus far in lab to explore a research question pertaining to your
specific interests.
This series of labs consists of a written lab report in RMarkdown and a
presentation to the class. For this project, you will choose a question or idea
pertaining to one of the previous labs and explore the topic a deeper. This may
consit of exploring the “why” portion of previous questions that only asked you
to describe patterns in the data or it may be evaluating relationships between
other variables not assesed in prior labs. To answer your question, you may use
the any of the data from lab 2, the MODTRAN model, the RRTM model, the GEOCARB
model, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p>Please get your topic approved by either
Professor Gilligan or Ms. Best by Feb. 21.</p>
<p>The lab report for your project is <strong>due Mar. 19 at 11:59 PM</strong>.</p>
<div id="solo-or-team-projects" class="section level2">
<h2>Solo or Team Projects</h2>
<p>You may choose to do this project individually or with a partner as a team
effort. If you work with a partner, you may work together to design the
question, obtain and analyze data, make a team presentation, and write a report
together. We expect teams to include a note in the report that indicates which
member contributed what to the report (this does not need to be super detailed
and can say, “Alice and Bob designed the experiment together. Bob wrote the
code to run the models. Alice wrote the code for the data analysis.
Alice and Bob contributed equally to writing the discussion and conclusions.”)
This is similar to the requirement at many research journals that
co-authored papers include a statement of what each author contributed.</p>
</div>
<div id="choosing-a-topic" class="section level2">
<h2>Choosing a Topic</h2>
<p>For undergraduates, we recommend that you choose a topic from one of the
exercises that you did in labs #2–5 and think of a new question along the same
lines as the questions that exercise asked.
For graduate students, we expect you to try something more ambitious than just
simple extensions of the questions from the lab exercises, but it is still fine
to take one of the lab exercises as a starting point.</p>
<p>If you want to do something really different than what we have done previously
in lab, that is fine. But check with one of us to make sure your plan is
appropriate and feasible (we don’t want you to bite off more than you can chew).</p>
<p><strong>Be CrEaTiVe!</strong> Now is the time to really explore parts of the class that you
have found interesting and present your findings in a unique, exciting way.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="writen-report-due-mar.-19" class="section level1">
<h1>Writen Report (Due Mar. 19)</h1>
<p>Your report should be comprehensive, yet not overly verbose. One recommendation
for achieving this is to create an outline to organize your thoughts before
initializing writing and data analysis. The report needs to include the
following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Introduction</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Provide background information that frames the problem you are
addressing. At the end of the introduction, the reader should understand
exactly <strong>what the problem is</strong> that you are addressing and why that
problem is <strong>interesting</strong> and <strong>relevant</strong> to the climate system.</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Methods</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Describe the methods for answering your question. The methods section
should be written such that someone completely unfamiliar with your
project could follow your steps and recreate your results.</em></p></li>
<li><p>This section should contain the R code you use to do the analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Getting data into R: download from the internet, read it in from
files on your computer, run models, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Process data to clean it up: use functions like <code>mutate</code>, <code>gather</code>,
<code>summarize</code>, etc. to convert the data into a useful form.</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze data: anything you do to analyze the data, such as generating
descriptive statistics like the mean or standard deviation, fitting
linear models to get slopes (rates of change), etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Results</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Describe the results of your analyses. Include apropriate charts,
tables, graphs, and other quantitative representations of data.</em></p></li>
<li><p>This section should have R code for making graphs, tables, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Conclusions/Discussion</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Discuss the implications for the results you found using data from your
results section.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Why are these results significant or interesting?</p></li>
<li><p>What data supports these conclusions?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the broader implications of these results?</p></li>
<li><p>From the results that you have found, what are the next steps to
take in this line of research? What other questions have arisen as a
result of your analyses?</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Works Cited</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Include a works cited section to credit the research and thoughts that
are not your own. Be sure to use citations throughout your report where
necessary.</em></p></li>
<li><p>We will post a separate document that explains how to do citations and
bibliographies in RMarkdown.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Final reports are to be pushed to your Lab 6 Github repository
<em>no later than 11:59 PM on Mar. 19</em>.
<strong>You must push the .Rmd file <em>and</em> the knitted PDF</strong> to Github.
A portion of your final report grade will reflect effective use of
R/RMarkdown/Github, the clarity and succinctness of your writing,
visual representations of data, appropriate discussion of results,
and insights into future analyses.</p>
<div id="making-pdf-output-from-rmarkdown" class="section level2">
<h2>Making PDF output from RMarkdown</h2>
<p>To make PDF output from RMarkdown, you need to install a program called
“LaTeX” (pronounced “layteck”, rhyming with “tech”). I describe how to do
this on <a href="https://ees3310.jgilligan.org/tools/#installing-latex">“Tools” section</a>
of the class web site, but I will summarize here:
The easiest way to install LaTeX for RMarkdown is to use the <code>tinytex</code>
package in R. To do this, execute the following commands at the RStudio
console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;tinytex&quot;)
library(tinytex)
install_tinytex(extra_packages=c(&quot;mhchem&quot;, &quot;mathptmx&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>This may take 5-10 minutes to complete, so you probably want to wait until a
time when you won’t need your computer for a bit before you do it.</p>
<p>An alternative, but which is more involved and will use more space on your disk,
would be to install the <a href="https://miktex.org">MikTeX package</a> from
<a href="https://miktex.org">miktex.org</a>. Instructions for doing this are presented on
the <a href="https://ees3310.jgilligan.org/tools/#installing-latex">Tools</a> section of
the class web site.</p>

</div>
<div id="presentation-due-mar.-30" class="section level1">
<h1>Presentation (Due Mar. 30)</h1>
<p>I have moved the due date for the presentation to
Mar. 30 and I am giving you two options.
Whichever option you take (written or recorded video), it will be due
on the presentation date Mar. 30, not the
report due date.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>You and your team can coordinate a recorded video presentation of 5–10
minutes per person about your presentation.</li>
<li>The other option, instead of recording a video, is to write a short
(roughly 2 page, double-spaced) press release to accompany your report.</li>
</ol>
<div id="video-presentation" class="section level2">
<h2>Video Presentation</h2>
<p>You may use any software that you’re comfortable with to record your
presentation.</p>
<div id="using-powerpoint" class="section level3">
<h3>Using Powerpoint</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Powerpoint has a recorder that will let you to record yourself giving
a powerpoint presentation.
However, this is not set up well to record multiple people in
different places jointly recording a presentation, so it’s best if you
are doing your project by yourself.</p>
<p>To use the recorder, open the “Slide Show”
menu (see the figure below), select “Use presenter view”, and click on
“Record slide show”</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="_images/lab_06/record_pp_slideshow.png" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Powerpoint slide show menu</p>
</div>
<p>Then you will see the presenter view, as shown below.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="_images/lab_06/pp_recording_view.jpg" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Powerpoint recording presenter view</p>
</div>
<p>You will see your slide show with a video inset showing the view from
your webcam (if you have one). After you click on the “record” button,
Powerpoint will record your voice narration and video from your webcam
as well as the slideshow.</p>
<p>You can click on “pause” if you need to pause partway
through to collect your thoughts.</p>
<p>You can draw on the slides by clicking on the pen or highlighter tool
at the bottom of the screen. You can also use your mouse as a laser
pointer to point at things on your slideshow by right clicking, opening
the “Pointer options” menu, and choosing “Laser pointer”.</p>
<p>When you’re done, click the “Stop” button at the top of the recording
screen.</p>
<p>You can play back your slideshow by clicking “From the beginning” in
the “Start slideshow” are at the left of the slideshow menu.</p>
<p>The video and audio narration will be stored in the powerpoint file
when you save the presentation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="using-different-software" class="section level3">
<h3>Using Different Software</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you want to use different software to record yourself giving your
slideshow, that’s fine too.</li>
</ul>
<div id="kaltura-capture" class="section level4">
<h4>Kaltura Capture</h4>
<p>Brightspace has a tool called “Kaltura capture” for capturing video
and screens and you can learn more here:
<a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/how-do-i-use-kaltura-capture-in-kaltura/" class="uri">https://www.vanderbilt.edu/brightspace/how-do-i-use-kaltura-capture-in-kaltura/</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="zoom" class="section level4">
<h4>Zoom</h4>
<p>You can also use Zoom:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Start a Zoom meeting with your partner or partners, unmute your
microphones, and enable video if you want to have video insets
from your team’s webcams as you make your presentation.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, the person who started the meeting should do the following
steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>start the powerpoint presentation</p></li>
<li><p>Then, go to the Zoom window, click “Share Screen”, and share the
powerpoint presentation window.</p>
<p>Now everyone on the meeting can see the Powerpoint window.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, go back to the Zoom window and click “Record” to start
recording.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure you have Zoom configured to record to your computer,
not the cloud.</p>
<p>This is because their cloud processors are backed up from all the
people using Zoom, so there may be a very long delay (a whole day
or more) before the video is ready to download.</p></li>
<li><p>Now you can go to the Powerpoint window and do your presentation.
It will be recorded on Zoom.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If you want to transfer control of the Powerpoint window to a
pertner on the Zoom call, there are instructions here:
<a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Request-or-Give-Remote-Control" class="uri">https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362673-Request-or-Give-Remote-Control</a></p>
<p>Here is a summary: a partner on the Zoom call can click on the
“View options” menu on the shared Powerpoint window and click
“Request remote control” and then the person who started the
meeting can allow remote control.</p>
<p>Alternately, the person who started the meeting can initiate this
and click the “Remote Control” button at the bottom of the Zoom
meeting screen and give remote control to the partner.</p>
<p>When the partner is done with remote conntrolling the presentation,
they can click the “View Options” menu and select
“Give up Remote Control.”</p>
<p>You can tell the remote control status because when you are
remotely controlling someone else’s shared screen, the title
at the top of the window turns from green (for passively viewing)
to yellow and says “You are controlling <em>so-and-so</em>’s screen”,
where <em>so-and-so</em> is the person’s name.</p></li>
<li><p>When you’re done, Zoom will process the video and save it on your
computer.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="uploading-your-video-presentation" class="section level3">
<h3>Uploading your video presentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>After you’re done recording your presentation, upload it to Box and share
the Box folder with
Professor Gilligan and Ms. Best.
As an optional alternative, you can upload it to YouTube and send the link
to
Professor Gilligan and Ms. Best.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div id="press-release" class="section level2">
<h2>Press Release</h2>
<p>The other option, instead of recording a video, is to write a short
(roughly 2 page, double-spaced) press release to accompany your report.</p>
<p>Your report has the format of a formal scientific report, with an
introduction, methods, results, discussion, and conclusions.
The press release should be a description of your project for the general
public. It should have the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Start by briefly describing the important result (what you found out from
your project) and make it sound exciting or interesting in one or two
sentences. This is what journalists call the <em>lede</em>: The first sentence
of a story should grab the reader and make them want to read more. Write
in the third person, so something like, “A team of students at Vanderbilt
University discovered …”</p></li>
<li><p>Next, back up and introduce the research team
(names and other information about yourselves that the reader might be
interested in, such as your major, if you’re a first-year, sophomore,
etc.), describe the research question you are investigating,
and explain why someone would be interested in it.</p></li>
<li><p>Now that the reader knows your quesiton and why they might be interested
in it, you can describe what you found out and what its significance is.
This should be the bulk of your press release. Try to make your research
question and the answer you found relevant to people’s lives by connecting
them to aspects of climate change that someone in the general public may
be thinking about.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, you can describe very briefly and in very general terms that are
accessible to someone who doesn’t know much about climate change what you
did to answer the question (this should <em>not</em> have technical detail; it
should be a very general description in simple language).</p></li>
</ol>
