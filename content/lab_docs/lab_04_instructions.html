<h1>Note:</h1>
<p>Something to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>One big piece of this lab is to use RMarkdown to write a report that really
integrates text with code and graphics and tables that are generated by
RMarkdown. Use the fact that you can easily check your answers to the specific
questions to give you some freedom to think about how you want to present your
answers. Don’t just copy and paste from my answers, but think about how you
would use RMarkdown to present your answers in your own way.</li>

<div id="exercises-with-lapse-rate-and-clouds." class="section level1">
<h1>Exercises with lapse rate and clouds.</h1>
<p>In this lab, you will learn about a new climate model, RRTM.
RRTM stands for “Rapid Radiative Transfer Model.”
This model is a radiative-convective model that uses code
from the radiative-transfer portion of a state-of-the-art global climate model
called the “Community Earth System Model,” developed at the National Center
for Atmospheric Research in Boulder CO.</p>
<p>The entire CESM model runs on giant supercomputers, but this radiative transfer
module can run efficiently on an ordinary computer. In order to speed up the
calculations, RRTM does not calculate the entire longwave spectrum the way
MODTRAN does, but uses a simplified approximation that is much faster when
the big climate models need to run this radiative transfer calculation
roughly 52 quadrillion
(5.2×10<sup>15</sup>) times in a
simulation of 100 years of the earth’s climate.</p>
<p>An advantage that RRTM has over MODTRAN, is that MODTRAN assumes that the
atmosphere is static (none of the air moves), whereas RRTM allows for
convective heat flow. This makes RRTM more realistic, even though it sacrifices
detail in its treatment of longwave radiation.</p>
<p>We will use RRTM to explore the role of convection in the earth system
and to examine the water-vapor feedback in the presence of convection.</p>
<p>You can run the RRTM model interactively on the web at
<a href="http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/" class="uri">http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/</a>
and I have also written a script that allows you to run it from R.</p>
<p>To run the model interactively, you can adjust various parameters, such as the
brightness of the sun, the albedo (it gives you a choice of many natural and
human-made surfaces, such as asphalt, concrete, forest, grassland, snow, ocean,
and the average for the earth) the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> and methane,
the relative humidity, and the amount and type of high (cirrus) and
low (stratus) clouds.</p>
<p>You can also introduce aerosols typical of different parts of the earth, such as
cities (with soot, sulfates, and other pollution), deserts (with blowing dust),
oceans (with sea spray and salt), and a Pinatubo-like volcanic eruption.</p>
<p>Like MODTRAN, the RRTM model does not automatically adjust the surface
temperature.
Instead, it calculates the upward and downward flux of longwave and shortwave
radiation at 51 different levels of the atmosphere and reports whether the heat
flow is balanced (heat in = heat out) at the top of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>If the earth is <em>gaining</em> heat, you can manually <em>raise</em> the surface temperature
until you balance the heat flow, and if the earth is <em>losing</em> heat, you can
manually <em>lower</em> the temperature.</p>
<div id="r-interface-to-rrtm" class="section level2">
<h2>R Interface to RRTM</h2>
<p>I have written an R function <code>run_rrtm</code> that allows you to manually run
RRTM from R. To use this function, you need to include the line
<code>source("_scripts/rrtm.R")</code> or <code>source(file.path(script_dir, "rrtm.R"))</code>
to load it.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>run_rrtm()</code> allows you to automatically download a file
with the data from a MODTRAN run. You call it with the following arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>filename</code> is the name of the file to save the data to. The function
returns the output data, so it’s optional to specify a file name.</p></li>
<li><p><code>co2_ppm</code> is the amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in parts per million. The default is 400.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ch4_ppm</code> is the amount of methane in parts per million. The default is 1.7.</p></li>
<li><p><code>relative_humidity</code> is the relative humidity, in percent. The default is
80%.</p></li>
<li><p><code>T_surface</code> is the surface temperature, in Kelvin.
The default (for 400 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>, etc.) is 284.42.
You adjust this to restore radiative equilibrium after you change the
parameters (amount of CO<sub>2</sub>, lapse rate, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><code>I_solar</code> is the brightness of the sun, in Watts per square meter.
The default value is 1360.</p></li>
<li><p><code>surface_type</code> is the type of surface (this is used to calculate the
albedo). The default is `earth average. The options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<code>earth average</code>”: The average albedo of the earth (0.30)</li>
<li>“<code>asphalt</code>”: Dark asphalt (0.08)</li>
<li>“<code>concrete</code>”: Concrete (0.55)</li>
<li>“<code>desert</code>”: Typical desert (0.40)</li>
<li>“<code>forest</code>”: Typical forest (0.15)</li>
<li>“<code>grass</code>”: Typical grassland (0.25)</li>
<li>“<code>ocean</code>”: Ocean (0.10)</li>
<li>“<code>snow</code>”: Typical snow (0.85)</li>
<li>“<code>ice</code>”: Large ice masses covering ocean or land (0.60)</li>
<li>“<code>soil</code>”: Bare soil (0.17)</li>
<li>“<code>custom</code>”: Custom albedo (if you choose this, you need to also supply
a value for <code>albedo</code>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>tropopause_km</code> is the altitude of the tropopause, in kilometers above
sea level. The default value is 15, which is typical of middle latitudes.
The tropopause varies from place to place around the Earth, from around
9 km at the poles to around 17 km near the equator.</p></li>
<li><p><code>lapse_rate</code> is the lapse rate, in Kelvin per kilometer. The default is
6, which is roughly the global average environmental lapse rate.
The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10, so it’s physically impossible to
have an persistent environmental lapse rate greater than 10 and results
with <code>lapse_rate</code> greater than 10 won’t make sense.</p></li>
<li><p><code>low_cloud_frac</code> is the fraction (from 0.0–1.0) of the sky covered by
low (stratus) clouds. The default is 0.0.</p></li>
<li><p><code>high_cloud_frac</code> is the fraction (from 0.0–1.0) of the sky covered by
high (cirrus) clouds. The default is 0.0.</p></li>
<li><p><code>cloud_drop_radius</code> is the size of the water droplets in the clouds,
in microns. The default is 10. (For reference, 10 microns is about the
size of a red blood cell).
You can make the droplets smaller to simulate the indirect aerosol effect.</p></li>
<li><p><code>aerosols</code> allows you to set up the atmosphere with the kinds and
quantities of aerosols typical of a number of different environments.
Options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>“<code>none</code>”: No aerosols</li>
<li>“<code>ocean</code>”: Typical ocean aerosols (sea-spray, salt, etc.)</li>
<li>“<code>desert</code>”: Typical desert aerosols (dust, sand)</li>
<li>“<code>city</code>”: Typical city with soot (black carbon) and sulfate aerosols.</li>
<li>“<code>city just sulfates</code>”: Just sulfate aerosols typical of a city.</li>
<li>“<code>city just soot</code>”: Just soot (black carbon) aerosols typical of a
city.</li>
<li>“<code>land</code>”: Typical rural land (dust, etc.)</li>
<li>“<code>polluted land</code>”: Typical rural land suffering from pollution
(e.g., from farming)</li>
<li>“<code>antarctic</code>”: Typical aerosols for Antarctica</li>
<li>“<code>volcano</code>”: Similar sulfate and dust to the Mt. Pinatubo volcanic
eruption.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Any arguments you don’t specify explicitly take on their default value.
Thus, <code>run_rrtm(co2_ppm = 800, relative humidity = 10, T_surface = 300)</code>
would run with all the default values, except for 800 ppm CO<sub>2</sub>,
relative humidity of 10%, and a surface temperature of 300 Kelvin.</p>
<p><code>run_rrtm</code> returns a list of data containing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic parameters of the model run:
<ul>
<li><code>T_surface</code></li>
<li><code>co2_ppm</code></li>
<li><code>ch4_ppm</code></li>
<li><code>I_solar</code></li>
<li><code>albedo</code></li>
<li><code>lapse_rate</code></li>
<li><code>tropopause_km</code></li>
<li><code>relative_humidity</code></li>
<li><code>aerosols</code>,</li>
<li><code>low_cloud_frac</code></li>
<li><code>high_cloud_frac</code></li>
<li><code>cloud_drop_radius</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Results of the model calculations:
<ul>
<li><code>Q</code>: The heat imbalance <span class="math inline">\(I_{\text{in}} - I_{\text{out}}\)</span></li>
<li><code>i_in</code>: The net solar radiation absorbed by the earth
(<span class="math inline">\((1 - \alpha) I_{\text{solar}} / 4\)</span>)</li>
<li><code>i_out</code>: The net longwave radiation emitted to space from the top
of the atmosphere</li>
<li><code>profile</code>: A tibble containing a profile of the atmosphere
(altitude in km, pressure in millibar, and temperature in Kelvin)</li>
<li><code>fluxes</code>: A tibble containing the fluxes (in Watts per square
meter) of longwave, shortwave, and total radiation going up and
down at 52 levels from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.
The columns are <code>altitude</code> (km), <code>T</code> (temperature in K),
<code>P</code> (pressure in millibar), <code>sw_up</code> (upward shortwave), <code>sw_down</code>
(downward shortwave), <code>lw_up</code> (upward longwave), <code>lw_down</code>
(downward longwave), <code>total_up</code> (<code>sw_up</code> + <code>lw_up</code>), and
<code>total_down (</code>sw_down<code>+</code>lw_down`).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also functions for reading RRTM data files and plotting RRTM data:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>read_rrtm(file)</code> reads an RRTM file saved by <code>run_rrtm</code> and returns a
list of data just like the one returned by <code>run_rrtm</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>plot_heat_flows()</code>: plots the upward and downward fluxes of radiation from
an RRTM file or data structure. You can call it either with
<code>plot_rrtm(file = "filename")</code> or <code>plot_rrtm(data = rrtm_data)</code>, where
“<code>filename</code>” and “<code>rrtm_data</code>” stand for your own file name or RRTM data
structure returned by <code>run_rrtm</code> or <code>read_rrtm</code>.</p>
<p>You can also specify which wavelengths to plot. By default, it plots
shortwave (SW), longwave (LW), and total (SW + LW), but you can specify
one or more of <code>sw = FALSE</code>, <code>lw = FALSE</code>, or <code>total = FALSE</code> to
omit wavelengths.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="example-of-running-rrtm" class="section level2">
<h2>Example of running RRTM</h2>
<p>Here is an example of running RRTM:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>default_rrtm = run_rrtm()

# Surface temperature:
default_rrtm$T_surface</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 284.42</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Heat imbalance:
default_rrtm$Q</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0</code></pre>
<p>This run has surface temperature
284. K and a heat imbalance of
0 Watts per square meter.</p>
<div id="interpreting-rrtm-results" class="section level3">
<h3>Interpreting RRTM Results</h3>
<p>We can plot the heat flows as a function of altitude:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_heat_flows(default_rrtm)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/lab_docs/lab_04_instructions_files/figure-html/plot_rrtm_example-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>What you see in this plot are thick lines representing downward heat flow
and thin lines representing upward flow. The different colors represent
shortwave, longwave, and total (shortwave + longwave).</p>
<p>A few things to notice: At the top of the atmosphere, at
20. km,
there is very little longwave going down, but a lot of shortwave going down
(around 340. W/m<sup>2</sup>).
Conversely, there is a modest amount of shortwave going up
(around 100. W/m<sup>2</sup>),
but a lot of longwave going up (around
240. W/m<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p>The upward shortwave radiation is sunlight reflected from the atmosphere and
the earth’s surface.</p>
<p>The upward longwave radiation is emitted from the surface and the atmosphere.
You can see that the longwave radiation, both up and down, is greater closer to
the surface, where temperatures are warmer, and smaller at higher altitudes,
where the atmosphere is cooler.</p>
<p>If we look at the total radiation, we see that there is a good balance near the
top of the atmosphere (the upward and downward lines come together), but
in the lower atmosphere, there is a serious imbalance with downward fluxes
significantly larger than the upward ones.</p>
<p>This is a consequence of convection: The difference between the downward and
upward radiative fluxes is taken up by convection, which moves heat upward
when warm air rises and cool air sinks.</p>
</div>
<div id="determining-climate-sensitivity-with-rrtm" class="section level3">
<h3>Determining Climate Sensitivity with RRTM</h3>
<p>We can also use the RRTM model to study what happens when we double CO<sub>2</sub>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rrtm_double_co2 = run_rrtm(co2_ppm = 800)</code></pre>
<p>When we double CO<sub>2</sub> without changing the surface temperature
(T<sub>surface</sub> = 284.4 K),
this creates a heat imbalance of 4.2
W/m<sup>2</sup>. We can use the online interactive version of RRTM to adjust surface
temperature until the heat flows balance. The surface temperature where this
happens is 286.9 K and we can paste it into our
R code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>new_ts = 286.9 # Kelvin
rrtm_double_co2_balanced = run_rrtm(co2_ppm = 800, T_surface = new_ts)</code></pre>
<p>When we set T<sub>surface</sub> to
286.9 K, the heat
imbalance becomes 0
Watts/m<sup>2</sup>. The climate sensitivity is the change in equilibrium
T<sub>surface</sub> when you double CO<sub>2</sub>:
<span class="math inline">\(\Delta T_{2\times \text{CO}_2} = 286.9~\mathrm{K} - 284.4~\mathrm{K} = 2.5~\mathrm{K}\)</span>.
You may remember that in last week’s lab, we calculated the climate sensitivity
with MODTRAN (using constant relative humidity to enable water-vapor feedback)
and got <span class="math inline">\(\Delta T_{2\times\text{CO}_2} = 1.2\)</span> K for the tropical atmosphere
(it’s smaller for the other atmospheres), so this shows that including
convection in our calculations roughly doubles the climate sensitivity.</p>

<div id="new-r-and-rmarkdown-tricks" class="section level1">
<h1>New R and RMarkdown tricks</h1>
<p>Sometimes you may want to use different text into your document, depending
on what the result of a calculation is.</p>
<p>For instance, I might have a function called <code>foo</code> that returns a number
and I want to write something different if <code>foo(x)</code> &gt; x than if
<code>foo(x)</code> &lt; x. Here, the function <code>ifelse</code> can come in handy.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>foo = function(x) {
  x^2
}</code></pre>
<p>Now I can write <code>ifelse(foo(x) &lt; x, "less than", "greater than")</code>.
The following RMarkdown text:</p>
<pre><code>When x = 0.5, `foo(x)` is
`r x = 0.5; ifelse(foo(x) &lt; x, &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;greater than&quot;)` x,
but when x = 2.0, `foo(x)` is
`r x = 2.0; ifelse(foo(x) &lt; x, &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;greater than&quot;)` x.</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When x = 0.5, <code>foo(x)</code> is
less than x,
but when x = 2.0, <code>foo(x)</code> is
greater than x.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may have spotted a problem with the code above: What if <code>foo(x)</code> = x?
Then I need another <code>ifelse</code>:
<code>ifelse(foo(x) &lt; x, "less than", ifelse(foo(x) &gt; x, "greater than", "equal to"))</code>.
This is cumbersome to type into your text, so you might want to write a function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>compare_f = function(f, x) {
  # f is a function
  # x is a number or a numeric variable
  result = f(x)
  ifelse(result &lt; x, &quot;less than&quot;,
         ifelse(result &gt; x, &quot;greater than&quot;,
                &quot;equal to&quot;))
}</code></pre>
<p>Now I can just write <code>compare_f(foo, x)</code>:
The following RMarkdown text:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>When x = 0.5, `foo(x)` is `r compare_f(foo, 0.5)` x, but
when x = 2.0, `foo(x)` is `r compare_f(foo, 2.0)` x, and
when x = 1.0, `foo(x)` is `r compare_f(foo, 1.0)` x.</code></pre>
<p>becomes</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When x = 0.5, <code>foo(x)</code> is less than x, but
when x = 2.0, <code>foo(x)</code> is greater than x, and
when x = 1.0, <code>foo(x)</code> is equal to x.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may seem kind of strange, but a lot of people and organizations use
RMarkdown to prepare reports regularly using different data.
For instance, many businesses use RMarkdown to generate monthly reports
on sales, finances, etc., and using code like the <code>compare</code> function I
showed here can help to automate the reports, so that when they run the
report each month using different data, the text will adjust automatically to
reflect the new numbers.</p>
<p>It is also applicable to climate science, where many laboratories like to
update their reports every month or every year with the latest climate data.</p>

<div id="exercises" class="section level1">
<h1>Exercises</h1>
<p>These are the exercises you will work for the lab this week.</p>
<div id="general-instructions" class="section level2">
<h2>General Instructions</h2>
<p>In the past three weeks, we focused on mastering many of the basics of using
R and RMarkdown. For this week’s lab, when you write up the answers, I would
like you to think about integrating your R code chunks with your text.</p>
<p>For instance, you can describe what you’re going to do to answer the question,
and then for each step, after you describe what you’re going to do in that
step, you can include an R code chunk to do what you just described, and then
the subsequent text can either discuss the results of what you just did
or describe what the next step of the analysis will do.</p>
<p>This way, your answer can have several small chunks of R code that build on
each other and follow the flow of your text.</p>
<p>For this lab, you will use the RRTM model, which includes both radiation and
convection.</p>
<div id="exercise-1-lapse-rate" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 1: Lapse Rate</h3>
<p>Run the RRTM model in its default configuration and then vary the lapse rate
from 0 to 10 K/km. For each value of the lapse rate, adjust the surface
temperature until the earth loses as much heat as it gains (i.e., the value of
<em>Q</em> in the <code>run_rrtm</code> model output is zero.)</p>
<p>It will probably be easier to do this with the interactive version of the RRTM
model at <a href="http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/" class="uri">http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/</a> than with the R interface
<code>run_rrtm</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Make a tibble containing the values of the lapse rate and the corresponding
equilibrium surface temperature, and then (in your report):
<ul>
<li>Make a table showing lapse rate and temperature.</li>
<li>Make a plot with lapse rate on the horizontal axis and surface temperature
on the vertical axis.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Describe how the equilibrium surface temperature varies as the lapse rate
varies.</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div id="exercises-on-albedo-and-clouds" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercises on Albedo and Clouds</h2>
<p>For the following exercises, start off with the RRTM model in its default
configuration.
Record the ground temperature.
For each part of this exercise you will do the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You will adjust the albedo or the clouds.</p></li>
<li><p>You will compare the visible and longwave radiation going down through the
atmosphere to the surface and also the visible and longwave radiation
going up from the surface, through the atmosphere, to space.</p>
<p>The results of an RRTM model run have a tibble called <code>fluxes</code> with columns
for <code>altitude</code>, <code>sw_down</code>, <code>sw_up</code>, <code>lw_down</code>, <code>lw_up</code>, <code>total_down</code>, and
<code>total_up</code>, where <code>sw</code> means shortwave, <code>lw</code> means longwave, and <code>total</code>
is the sum of shortwave plus longwave.</p>
<p>The first row of this tibble is at ground-level and the last row
is at the top of the atmosphere.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>default_data = run_rrtm()
fluxes = default_data$fluxes
surface_fluxes = head(fluxes, 1) # get the first row
space_fluxes = tail(fluxes, 1)   # get the last row</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You will adjust the ground temperature until the heat coming in balances
the heat going out (the model will say,
“If the Earth has these properties … then it loses as much energy as it
gains.”</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="exercise-2-the-urban-heat-island" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 2: The urban heat island</h3>
<p>First, run the RRTM model in its default configuration and note the surface
temperature and the albedo.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>default = run_rrtm()
albedo_default = default$albedo
T_surface_default = default$T_surface</code></pre>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Change the surface type from “Earth’s average” to “Asphalt” (don’t change
the surface temperature until the instructions tell you to) and describe
the changes in the local climate:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the albedo?</li>
<li>Report the changes in shortwave and longwave light absorbed by
the surface and going out to space.</li>
<li>How much does the total balance of heat change (i.e., how many W/m<sup>2</sup> does
the Earth lose or gain)?</li>
<li>Now, adjust the ground temperature until the Earth loses as much energy as
it gains.</li>
<li>What is the new surface temperature?
How does it compare to the surface temperature in the default
configuration?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Change the surface albedo to “Concrete”. Answer the same questions as in part
(a).</p></li>
<li><p>In cities, streets and parking lots are usually paved with asphalt.
Roofs of houses and other buildings are often covered with asphalt shingles
or black rubber-like compounds.</p>
<p>The results you got in this exercise represent covering <em>the entire planet</em>
with asphalt or concrete, so they are far more extreme than you would get
from only covering <em>part of a city</em> with one material or the other, but
the general principle holds and in a city you would have much smaller
changes, but they would be in the same direction as you found here.</p>
<p>How would the choice of using asphalt for roads, parking lots, and roofs in
a large city affect the local climate in the city?
Would using low-albedo materials, such as concrete for streets and parking
lots and light-colored polymers for the roofs of buildings have a benefit
for the people living in the city?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="exercise-3-clouds" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 3: Clouds</h3>
<p>First, run the RRTM model in its default configuration and note the surface
temperature and the albedo.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Change the low cloud fraction to 0.70 (70%)</p>
<ul>
<li>Report the changes in shortwave and longwave light absorbed by the
surface and going out to space.</li>
<li>How much does the total balance of heat change
(i.e., how many W/m<sup>2</sup> does the Earth lose or gain)?</li>
<li>Adjust the temperature to bring the heat flows back into balance.</li>
<li>How much did the temperature change?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Repeat part (a), but with the low cloud fraction set to 0 and the high-cloud
fraction set to 0.20 (20%).</p></li>
