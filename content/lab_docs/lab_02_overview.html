<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is a brief introduction to data types, data structures, and
some of the functions and packages that we will use to manipulate
data in the labs.</p>
<p>There is a lot more, and two particular resources that I would recommend to you
are available free on the web.</p>
<div id="r-for-data-science" class="section level2">
<h2>R for Data Science</h2>
<p>The first resource is the book, <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz"><em>R for Data Science</em></a>,
by Hadley Wickham who wrote most of the <code>tidyverse</code> collection.
You can buy a print
version of the book from all the usual online sources, but Wickham has also
posted the full text on the web at <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/" class="uri">http://r4ds.had.co.nz/</a> to make it
available for free.
(Also, he wrote the whole book in RMarkdown, and if you’re curious you can get
the RMarkdown for the book from <a href="https://github.com/hadley/r4ds" class="uri">https://github.com/hadley/r4ds</a>).</p>
<p>The key parts of the book, from the perspective of the labs for this course,
are
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-basics.html">Chapter 4: “Workflow Basics,”</a>
which presents a brief overview of R and
how to program with it;
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html">Chapter 5: “Data Transformation,”</a>
which explains the
functions I discuss in the first part of this handout about data frames
(also called tibbles) and the
manipulating them with functions like <code>select</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>mutate</code>, and
<code>summarize</code>; and
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html">Chapter 3: “Data Visualization,”</a>
which describes using
the <code>ggplot2</code> package to make graphs and charts of your data.
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html">Chapter 12, “Tidy Data”</a>
describes using the <code>pivot</code> functions to organize
your data in ways that make it easier to analyze.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about R, Section II of the book
discusses the different data types that R uses in detail
(<em>data frames</em>, also called <em>tibbles</em>;
character data, also called <em>strings</em>; factors; and dates and times).
Section III discusses
programming, and section IV discusses statistical modeling (i.e., fitting
functions to data). Section V discusses RMarkdown and all the different ways
you can use it to communicate about your analysis with other people.</p>
<p>The book is an excellent introduction to data analysis with
R. I have recommended it to many people who did not previously have experience
working with programming or R and they found it a very accessible, useful,
and user-friendly introduction.</p>
</div>
<div id="online-documentation-for-the-tidyverse" class="section level2">
<h2>Online documentation for the tidyverse</h2>
<p><a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><em>R for Data Science</em></a> is a great introduction to the
concepts behind the <code>tidyverse</code> collection of packages and functions for R,
but what should you do when you already understand that big picture and just
want to know how to do a specific task? For that, the online documentation for
the <code>tidyverse</code> is very useful and you can find it at
<a href="http://www.tidyverse.org/packages/" class="uri">http://www.tidyverse.org/packages/</a>.</p>
<p>This page has links to the documentation for all the major tidyverse packages:
<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/"><code>ggplot2</code></a> for making graphics,
<a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/"><code>dplyr</code></a> and
<a href="https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/"><code>tidyr</code></a> for working with <code>data.frames</code> and
<a href="https://tibble.tidyverse.org/"><code>tibbles</code></a>,
<a href="https://readr.tidyverse.org/"><code>reader</code></a> for reading in data from text files and
<a href="https://readxl.tidyverse.org/"><code>readxl</code></a> for reading data from Excel
spreadsheets, and many more packages that we will not be using in these labs.</p>
<p>The documents give lots of examples showing what the functions do and
explanations of how to do many common tasks. Especially for
<a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/"><code>ggplot2</code></a>, it can be very useful
to look at the graphs in the examples to find something that looks like what
you’re trying to do and then seeing the code that made that happen.</p>

<div id="data-in-r" class="section level1">
<h1>Data in R</h1>
<div id="kinds-of-variables" class="section level2">
<h2>Kinds of variables</h2>
<p>R is capable of analyzing many different kinds of data. Some of the most
important kinds of data that we may work with are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Integer data</strong>, which represents discrete quantities, such as counting
events or objects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Real number data</strong>, which represents quantities that can have fractional
values.
Most of the data we will work with in this course, such as temperatures,
altitudes, amounts of rainfall, and so forth, will be real-number data.
This kind of data is also referred to frequently as “floating point” data
or (for obscure reasons having to do with computer hardware) as “double”
or “double-precision” data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Character data</strong>, which represents text. Examples include names of months,
or categories (such as the name of a city or country). This kind of data is
also referred to as “string data”.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>factor data</strong>, which represents variables that can only take on
certain discrete values. R treats factor data as a kind of augmented character
data.</p>
<p>The difference between character data and factor data is that factor
data has an explicit set of allowed values and has an integer number
associated with each of those values.</p>
<p>For instance, if I have a factor variable with the allowed values “up” and
“down”, then I could not assign it a value “left” or “right”, whereas a
character variable can be assigned any arbitrary text, such as
“second star to the right and straight on til morning.”</p>
<p>There are two kinds of factors: ordered and unordered. The difference is that
the legal values for ordered factors have a specific order, so you can say
that one comes before or after another (or is greater than or less than
another), whereas unordered factors don’t have any natural ordering.</p>
<p>Examples of ordered variables might be the months of the year, or the days
of the week, or a grouping like “small”, “medium”, “large”, or
“bad”, “fair”, “good”.</p>
<p>Examples of unordered variables might be lists of states, gender, religion,
cities, sports teams, or other descriptive characteristics that don’t
have a natural order to them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>date and time data</strong>, which represents calendar dates, times of day, or
a combination, such as 9:37 PM on January 17, 1984.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the most part, R handles different data types sensibly so you don’t need to
worry about them, but sometimes when R is reading data in from files, or when
you want to convert one kind of variable to another, you will need to think
about these.</p>
<p>The most common cases where you will need to think about this is when you are
reading data in from files. Sometimes it is ambiguous whether to treat something
from a file as character data, numerical data, or a date. In such cases, you may
need to give R guidance about how to interpret data. The functions for reading
data in from files, such as <code>read_csv</code> and <code>read_table</code> allow you to specify
whether a given column of data in a table is integer, double-precision
(floating point), character, date, etc.</p>
<p>R also provides functions for converting data. The <code>as.character</code> function
takes data that might be character, factor, or numeric, and represent it as
text (characters).</p>
<p><code>as.numeric</code> or <code>as.integer</code> will allow you to convert a character variable to
a number. For instance, <code>as.numeric("3.14")</code> converts a text variable “3.14”
into a numeric variable 3.14.</p>
<p><code>as.integer</code> is very useful when we want to convert an ordered factor to an
integer that corresponds to the order of that value. For instance, if I have
an ordered factor <code>f</code> with legal values corresponding to the months of the year
(“Jan”, “Feb”, …, “Dec”), if <code>f</code> has the value <code>Mar</code>, then
<code>as.integer(f)</code> will have the integer value 3.</p>
</div>
<div id="vectors-lists-data-frames-and-tibbles." class="section level2">
<h2>Vectors, Lists, Data Frames, and Tibbles.</h2>
<p>In statistics, you generally don’t just work with one number at a time, but with
collections of numbers. R provides many ways to work with collections of
numbers.</p>
<div id="vectors" class="section level3">
<h3>Vectors</h3>
<p>The simplest is a <strong>vector</strong>. A vector is a collection of values that are all
of the same kind: a collection of integers, a collection of floating point
values, a collection of character values, a collection of factor values, etc.</p>
<p>You specify vectors like this: <code>x = c(1, 2, 5, 9, 3, 4, 2, 7, 5)</code>.
You can access elements of vectors by indexing their position within the
vector, so <code>x[3]</code> will be 5 and <code>x[4]</code> will be 9.</p>
<p>You can also give the elements of a vector names:
<code>ages = c(Sam = 27, Ben = 20, Sarah = 25, Deborah = 31)</code> allows you to use
<code>ages["Ben"]</code>, which will be 20.</p>
<p>All of the elements of a vector have to be the same kind, so
<code>x = c(1, 2, "three")</code> will not allow the vector to mix numbers and characters
and R will transform all of the values to character. The result is
<code>"1", "2", "three"</code>, and <code>x[1] + x[2]</code> will give an error because
R doesn’t know how to add two character variables. However,
<code>as.numeric(x[1]) + as.numeric(x[2])</code> will yield 3.</p>
</div>
<div id="lists" class="section level3">
<h3>Lists</h3>
<p>Lists are a lot like vectors, but they can contain different kinds of variables.
They can even contain lists and vectors.
<code>x = list(1, 2, "three", list(4, 5, 6))</code> has four elements. The first two are
the numbers 1 and 2; the third is the character string “three”, and the fourth
is the list <code>(4,5,6)</code>.</p>
<p>Just as we can have named vectors, we can have named lists:
<code>ages = list(Sam = 27, Ben = 20, Sarah = 25, Deborah = 31)</code>.
There is a nice shortcut to getting the elements of a named list, using a
dollar sign: <code>ages$Sam</code> is 27.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-frames-and-tibbles" class="section level3">
<h3>Data frames and <em>tibbles</em></h3>
<p>We will not use lists very much in this class. We will use vectors a little bit,
but what we will use <em>a lot</em> are tables of data. You have probably worked a
lot with spreadsheets and other data analysis tools that organize data in a
table with rows and columns. This is a very natural and common way to work.</p>
<p>R provides a structure called a <code>data.frame</code> for working with tabular data, but
the package <code>tidyverse</code> introduces an improved version of the <code>data.frame</code>
called a <code>tibble</code> (think of it as a kind of data table).
Since <code>data.frames</code> and <code>tibbles</code> are so similar, I will mostly use the two
terms interchangeably.</p>
<p><code>data.frames</code> and <code>tibbles</code> have rows and columns. A row represents a set of
quantities, such as measurements or observations, that go together in some way.
Different rows in a tibble represent different sets of these quantities.</p>
<p>For instance, if I am measuring the height and weight of a number of people,
then I would have a row for each person and each row would have a column for the
person’s name or identity code, a column for their height, and a column for
their weight.</p>
<p>If I am measuring the average temperature and average precipitation
for a number of cities, then I would have a column for the city, a column for
the temperature, and a column for the precipitation.</p>
<p>Each column of a <code>data.frame</code> or <code>tibble</code> should correspond to a specific kind
of data (integer, floating point, character, factor, date, etc.). A column is
a kind of vector, so it has to obey the restrictions that apply to vectors.</p>
<p>To get some experience with data frames, let’s load a couple of data sets that
I have prepared. If you have cloned the directory for this document
(from <a href="https://github.com/gilligan-ees-3310/lab_02_documentation" class="uri">https://github.com/gilligan-ees-3310/lab_02_documentation</a>),
you can load the datasets, which contain daily weather summaries for
Nashville and Chicago,
by running the code below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>nashville_weather = readRDS(&#39;_data/nashville_weather.Rds&#39;)
chicago_weather = readRDS(&#39;_data/chicago_weather.Rds&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>Here is an example of the first few rows of a tibble with weather data for
Nashville from
1950–2020:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(nashville_weather)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 6
##   id          date        prcp  tmin  tmax location     
##   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;date&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        
## 1 USW00013897 1950-01-01   104    89   117 Nashville, TN
## 2 USW00013897 1950-01-02   287   117   144 Nashville, TN
## 3 USW00013897 1950-01-03     0   144   189 Nashville, TN
## 4 USW00013897 1950-01-04   191     6   211 Nashville, TN
## 5 USW00013897 1950-01-05   572     0    44 Nashville, TN
## 6 USW00013897 1950-01-06   160   -17   167 Nashville, TN</code></pre>
<p>There are 6 columns: the weather station ID for the Nashville Airport,
the date of the measurement, the daily precipitation (in millimeters),
the daily minimum and maximum temperatures (Celsius), and the name of the
location.</p>
<p>The tibble also shows the kind of variable that each column represents:
<code>id</code> and <code>location</code> are character data, <code>date</code> is Date data, and
<code>prcp</code>, <code>tmin</code>, and <code>tmax</code> are double-precision floating point data
(i.e., real numbers).<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>In some ways, a tibble or <code>data.frame</code> is like a named list of vectors,
where each vector in the list is a column and its name is the name of the
column.
We can access individual columns using the dollar sign, just as with regular
named lists:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>precipitation = nashville_weather$prcp</code></pre>
<p>And we can see what the result is:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(precipitation)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 104 287   0 191 572 160</code></pre>
<p>RStudio has a nice feature that lets you examine a tibble or <code>data.frame</code>
as though it were a spreadsheet. To examine one of R’s built-in data sets,
which has data on hurricanes in the Atlantic from 1975–2015:
<code>View(dplyr::storms)</code>
(note that <code>View</code> has a capital “V”).</p>
<p>Some other useful functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can get a list of the names of
a named vector, a named list, or the columns of a tibble or <code>data.frame</code>
with the <code>names</code> function: <code>names(x)</code>, where x is a vector, list,
tibble, or <code>data.frame</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>You can get the length of a vector or list with the <code>length</code> function,
and you can get the number of rows and columns in a tibble using the
<code>dim</code> function:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(&quot;Length of x is&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Length of x is&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(length(x))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 5</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(&quot;Dimensions of dplyr::storms is &quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Dimensions of dplyr::storms is &quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>print(dim(dplyr::storms))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 10010    13</code></pre>
<p>That’s 10010 rows and 13 columns.
You can also get just the number of rows or the number of columns
with <code>nrow()</code> and <code>ncol()</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-tidyverse" class="section level1">
<h1>The Tidyverse</h1>
<p>The “tidyverse” is a collection of packages written by Hadley Wickham
to make it easy to work with data frames. Wickham developed an improved
kind of data frame that has features that are lacking in the basic R
<code>data.frame</code>, and he developed a collection of tools for manipulating,
analyzing, and graphing data from tibbles and regular <code>data.frames</code>.</p>
<p>The tidyverse is explained in detail in the book,
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><em>R for Data Science</em></a>, which you can read online at
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html" class="uri">https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html</a>.</p>
<p>To use the tidyverse, we need to load the package using R’s <code>library</code> function.
If tidyverse is not installed on your computer, you will get an error message
and you will have to run <code>install.packages("tidyverse")</code> before you can
proceed.</p>
<p>When you load <code>tidyverse</code>, it automatically loads a bunch of useful packages
for manipulating and analyzing data: <code>tibble</code>, <code>dplyr</code>, <code>tidyr</code>, <code>purrr</code>,
<code>readr</code>, and <code>ggplot2</code>.</p>
<p>If you have the <code>pacman</code> package installed, it can help you avoid these error
messages: after you load <code>pacman</code> with <code>library(pacman)</code>, then you can load
other packages using <code>p_load(tidyverse)</code> (you can substituate any other
package name for “tidyverse”): pacman will first see whether you have that
package on your computer; if you do, pacman will load it, and if you don’t
pacman will install the package from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)
and then load it.</p>
<p>In the code below, I will also load the <code>lubridate</code> package, which is part of
<code>tidyverse</code> but is not loaded automatically when you load <code>tidyverse</code>.
<code>lubridate</code> provides useful functions for working with dates, which will
come in handy as we work with the weather data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
# alternately, I could do the following:
# library(pacman)
# p_load(tidyverse, lubridate)</code></pre>
<div id="manipulating-data-frames" class="section level2">
<h2>Manipulating Data Frames</h2>
<p>One part of the <code>tidyverse</code> is the package <code>dplyr</code>, which has many useful
tools for modifying and manipulating tibbles:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>select</code> lets you choose a subset of columns from a tibble</li>
<li><code>rename</code> lets you rename columns</li>
<li><code>filter</code> lets you choose a subset of rows from a tibble</li>
<li><code>arrange</code> lets you sort the rows with respect to the values of different columns</li>
<li><code>mutate</code> lets you modify the values of columns or add new columns</li>
<li><code>summarize</code> lets you generate summaries of columns (e.g., the mean, maximum,
or minimum value of that column)</li>
<li><code>group_by</code> and <code>ungroup</code> let you perform calculations with grouping (e.g., in
combination with summarize, you can group by year to produce separate summaries
for each year)</li>
<li><code>bind_rows</code> to combine multiple tibbles that have the same kinds of columns
by stacking one above the other.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot more, but these functions will be enough to keep us busy for now
and they will allow us to do some powerful analysis.</p>
<p>If you want to learn more about these functions, they are explained in detail in
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html">Chapter 5</a> of
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><em>R for Data Science</em></a>.</p>
<div id="manipulating-columns" class="section level3">
<h3>Manipulating Columns</h3>
<p>Let’s start with <code>select</code>: You can select columns to keep or columns to delete.</p>
<p>Here are the first few rows of <code>nashville_weather</code></p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(nashville_weather)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 6
##   id          date        prcp  tmin  tmax location     
##   &lt;chr&gt;       &lt;date&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        
## 1 USW00013897 1950-01-01   104    89   117 Nashville, TN
## 2 USW00013897 1950-01-02   287   117   144 Nashville, TN
## 3 USW00013897 1950-01-03     0   144   189 Nashville, TN
## 4 USW00013897 1950-01-04   191     6   211 Nashville, TN
## 5 USW00013897 1950-01-05   572     0    44 Nashville, TN
## 6 USW00013897 1950-01-06   160   -17   167 Nashville, TN</code></pre>
<p>Let’s get rid of the <code>id</code> column, since we don’t really care about the ID number,
that meteorological agencies use to identify the weather station.
and let’s get rid of the <code>location</code> column because we know that the data set
is from Nashville, so having that information repeated on each row is a waste
of space.
To do this, we just call select, specifying the tibble or <code>data.frame</code> to
operate on, and then give a list of columns to eliminate, with a minus sign
in front of each:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x = select(nashville_weather, -id, -location)
head(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 4
##   date        prcp  tmin  tmax
##   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1 1950-01-01   104    89   117
## 2 1950-01-02   287   117   144
## 3 1950-01-03     0   144   189
## 4 1950-01-04   191     6   211
## 5 1950-01-05   572     0    44
## 6 1950-01-06   160   -17   167</code></pre>
<p>Alternately, instead of telling select which columns to get rid of, we can tell
it which columns to keep:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x = select(nashville_weather, date, prcp, tmin, tmax)
head(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 4
##   date        prcp  tmin  tmax
##   &lt;date&gt;     &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;
## 1 1950-01-01   104    89   117
## 2 1950-01-02   287   117   144
## 3 1950-01-03     0   144   189
## 4 1950-01-04   191     6   211
## 5 1950-01-05   572     0    44
## 6 1950-01-06   160   -17   167</code></pre>
<p>We can specify a range of consecutive columns by giving the first and last with a
colon between them:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x = select(nashville_weather, date:tmax)
head(x)</code></pre>

<p>In the code above, I used the <code>year</code> function from the <code>lubridate</code> package to extract just the year from a date.</p>
<p>One thing that is important to know about making comparisons in <code>filter</code> expressions: to specify that two things are
equal, you write <code>==</code> with two equal signs. A single equal sign is for assigning a value to a variable and two
equal signs are for comparisons. You can also use “&lt;=” for less than or equal to and “&gt;=” for greter than or equal to.</p>

<p>In the code above, I used the <code>ymd</code> function from <code>lubridate</code> to translate a character
value “2016-06-10” to the date value for June 10, 2016.</p>
<p>You can combine conditions in <code>filter</code> by using <code>&amp;</code> to indicate
“and” and <code>|</code> to indicate “or”.</p>
<p>We can sort the rows of a tibble or <code>data.frame</code> with the <code>arrange</code> function:</p>

<p>This sorts the rows in descending order of <code>tmax</code> (i.e., so the largest values are at the top),
and where multiple rows have the same value of <code>tmax</code>, then it sorts them in ascending order
of <code>tmin</code>. Observe the three rows with <code>tmax</code> = 41.7, the two rows where <code>tmax</code> = 41.1,
and the four rows where <code>tmax</code> = 40.6.</p>
<p>By default, <code>head</code> takes the first 6 rows of a tibble, but we can override that,
to return a different number of rows.
Here, we told <code>head</code> to return the first 10 rows of <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>If we want to change the values in a column, or create new columns,
we can use the <code>mutate</code> function.
The weather data we have give temperatures in Celsius and the precipitation
in millimeters.
Let’s convert these to Fahrenheit and inches, respectively, and then let’s
create a <code>trange</code> column that will have the difference between the maximum
and minimum temperature.</p>
<p>There are 25.4 millimeters in an inch and we convert Celsius temperatures to
Fahrenheit using the equation</p>

<div id="summarizing-rows" class="section level3">
<h3>Summarizing rows</h3>
<p>Summaries are useful for finding averages and extreme values.
Let’s find the maximum and minimum temperatures and the most extreme rainfall
in the whole data set:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x = summarize(nashville_weather, prcp_max = max(prcp, na.rm = TRUE), 
              tmin_min = min(tmin, na.rm = TRUE), 
              tmax_max = max(tmax, na.rm = TRUE))
x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 3
##   prcp_max tmin_min tmax_max
##      &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;
## 1     1842     -400      428</code></pre>
<p><code>nashville_weather</code> has 25932 rows,
but summarize reduces it to a single summary row.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Here, the parameter <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> in <code>max</code> and <code>min</code> is a way to
tell R to ignore missing values when it calculates the maximum and minimum
values. Sometimes a data set will have missing values (for instance, suppose
the weather station was not working that day), and it indicates these with a
special value that appears as <code>NA</code>, meaning “not available”. Normally, if you
ask for the maximum, minimum, or mean value of a data series with missing
values, R will return <code>NA</code> because if some values are missing, it doesn’t know
what the actual maximum or minimum is—the missing values could have been the
largest or smallest. If you want R to ignore missing values and return the
maximum, minimum, or mean value of the data that you do have, then you add the
<code>na.rm = TRUE</code> parameter when you call <code>max()</code>, <code>min()</code>, <code>mean()</code>, or
other summary functions.</p>
<p>You can use summary to generate multiple summary quantities from a column:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x = summarize(nashville_weather, prcp_max = max(prcp), prcp_min = min(prcp))
x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 1 x 2
##   prcp_max prcp_min
##      &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;
## 1     1842        0</code></pre>
<p>We can also generate grouped summaries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x = ungroup(summarize(group_by(nashville_weather, year(date)), 
                      prcp_max = max(prcp), prcp_tot = sum(prcp)))
head(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   `year(date)` prcp_max prcp_tot
##          &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;
## 1         1950      846    16330
## 2         1951      973    14838
## 3         1952     1176    10113
## 4         1953      478    10502
## 5         1954      732    10862
## 6         1955      831    11539</code></pre>
<p>This provides the maximum one-day precipitation and the total annual
precipitation for each year</p>
<p>Note how difficult it is to read that grouped summary expression: the
<code>group_by</code> function is inside <code>summarize</code>, which is inside <code>ungroup</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>tidyverse</code> offers us a much nicer way to put these kind of complicated
expressions together using what it calls the “pipe” operator, <code>%&gt;%</code>.<br />
The pipe operator chains operations together, taking the result of the one on
the left and inserting it into the one on the right.</p>
<p>We can use the pipe operator to rewrite the expression above as</p>
<pre class="r"><code>x = nashville_weather %&gt;% group_by(year(date)) %&gt;% 
  summarize(prcp_max = max(prcp), prcp_tot = sum(prcp)) %&gt;%
  ungroup()
head(x)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##   `year(date)` prcp_max prcp_tot
##          &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;int&gt;    &lt;int&gt;
## 1         1950      846    16330
## 2         1951      973    14838
## 3         1952     1176    10113
## 4         1953      478    10502
## 5         1954      732    10862
## 6         1955      831    11539</code></pre>
<p>Now the expression is easier to read:
First we group <code>nashville_weather</code> by year;
then we summarize it by calculating the maximum daily precipitation
and the yearly total for each year;
and finally, after we summarize we ungroup.</p>
<p>You can combine any set of the <code>tidyverse</code> functions using the pipe operator,
so you could <code>select</code> columns, <code>filter</code> rows, <code>mutate</code> the values of columns,
and <code>summarize</code>, using the <code>%&gt;%</code> pipe operator to connect all of the different
operations in sequence.</p>
</div>
<div id="combining-rows" class="section level3">
<h3>Combining Rows</h3>
<p>Another useful command is <code>bind_rows</code>, which lets us combine tibbles:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>weather = bind_rows(nashville_weather, chicago_weather)</code></pre>
<p>This creates a single tibble that has all of the rows from <code>nashville_weather</code>
on top and all the rows from <code>chicago_weather</code> on the bottom.
Because the two tibbles have the same columns, the columns are matched up.</p>
<p>We can operate on this combined tibble:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>weather_summary = weather %&gt;% 
  mutate(year = year(date), t_range = tmax - tmin) %&gt;%
  group_by(year, location) %&gt;%

  arrange(year, location)

<h2>Tidy Data and Pivoting Data Frames</h2>
<p>The <code>tidyr</code> package in the tidyverse is used to make data <code>tidy</code>:
re-organizing the columns and rows of a <code>tibble</code> to make it easier to analyze.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to re-organize a data frame or tibble to collect many
columns into a single column, or we may want to separate one column of data
into many columns. These operations, which change the shape of the data frame,
are called “pivots”. Here, we will explore two powerful functions in the
tidyverse, <code>pivot_longer</code> and <code>pivot_wider</code>, and they are explained in detail in
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html#pivoting">the section on “Pivoting”</a>

<p>The tibble presents the average temperatures for different bands of latitude:
64%deg;N–90°N, 44°N==64°N, 24°N–44°N, Equator–24°N,
and the same for the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>If we wanted to plot all of these, we could do something like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(giss_zonal, aes(x = year)) + 
  geom_line(aes(y = x64n_90n, color = &quot;64N-90N&quot;)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = x44n_64n, color = &quot;44N-64N&quot;)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = x24n_44n, color = &quot;24N-44N&quot;)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = equ_24n, color = &quot;EQU-24N&quot;)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = x24s_equ, color = &quot;24S-EQU&quot;)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = x44s_24s, color = &quot;44S-24S&quot;)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = x64s_44s, color = &quot;64S-44S&quot;)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = x90s_64s, color = &quot;90S-64S&quot;)) +
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature anomaly&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/lab_docs/lab_02_overview_files/figure-html/bad_zonal_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This is a big mess. It would be hard to clean up the appearance, and would
require a lot of retyping if we decided to group the data into different bands
of latitude.</p>
<p>We can do this much more easily with the <code>pivot_longer</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>bands = names(giss_zonal) # column names of the tibble
bands = bands[-1] # drop the first column (&quot;year&quot;)
labels = c(&quot;64N-90N&quot;, &quot;44N-64N&quot;, &quot;24N-44N&quot;, &quot;EQU-24N&quot;, 
           &quot;24S-EQU&quot;, &quot;44S-24S&quot;, &quot;64S-44S&quot;, &quot;90S-64S&quot;)
tidy_zonal = giss_zonal %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(cols = -year, names_to = &quot;latitude&quot;, values_to = &quot;anomaly&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see what the result of this looks like:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(tidy_zonal)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 3
##    year latitude anomaly
##   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1  1880 x64n_90n   -0.81
## 2  1880 x44n_64n   -0.42
## 3  1880 x24n_44n   -0.26
## 4  1880 equ_24n    -0.16
## 5  1880 x24s_equ   -0.1 
## 6  1880 x44s_24s   -0.02</code></pre>
<p>Now we can clean up the <code>latitude</code> column a bit to make it more friendly for
human readers:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidy_zonal = tidy_zonal %&gt;%
  mutate(latitude = ordered(latitude, levels = bands, 
                            labels = labels)) %&gt;%
  arrange(year, latitude)

<p>In this, the <code>mutate</code> command converts the latitude band into an ordered factor
where the order is the order of the original columns.
This gets R to sort them in the order of latitude bands, instead of
alphabetically, when it makes the legend for the plot.
The <code>labels</code> parameter then changes the names from the original column name,
which was somewhat cryptic, to something a person can make sense of.</p>
<p>Now let’s plot it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(tidy_zonal, aes(x = year, y = anomaly, color = latitude)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature anomaly&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/lab_docs/lab_02_overview_files/figure-html/plot_zonal_tibble-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The code for making the plot was a lot simpler, and by using an ordered factor,
we could control the order of the latitude bands in the legend, which now
appear in a sensible order. It is much easier to look at this graph and quickly
recognize that the far northern latitudes (64N–90N, and to a lesser extent
44N–64N) are warming up much faster than the rest of the planet.</p>
<p>Back in 1967, one of the first global climate models predicted that
global warming due to greenhouse gases would cause the far northern latitudes
to warm up much faster than the rest of the planet. This data confirms that
prediction.</p>
<p>We also see that the Southern Hemisphere has warmed much less than the Northern.
Think about why that might be.</p>
<p>The <code>pivot_wider</code> function is the inverse of <code>pivot_longer</code>.
It pivots a tibble by spreading one column of data into many columns,
using a second column to indicate the names of those columns.
For each row, the data in the “value” column is moved to a new column named by
the “key” column.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the <code>weather_summary</code> tibble we made above:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(weather_summary)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 5
##    year location      prcp_max prcp_tot t_range.max

<p>Let’s set it up to make it easy to compare the annual precipitation of
Nashville and Chicago:</p>

<h1>Graphing Data</h1>
<p>Here, we will look at the <code>ggplot2</code> package for plotting data. This
package is automatically loaded when you load the <code>tidyverse</code> collection
with <code>library(tidyverse)</code>. It follows a theory of making useful graphs
of data called, “The Grammar of Graphics” (that’s where the “gg” comes from).</p>
<p>The idea is that a graph has several distinct parts, which come together:</p>
<ul>
<li>One or more <em>layers</em> of graphics. A layer consists of the following:
<ul>
<li>A <em>data table</em> with one or more columns, each corresponding to a different
variable,</li>
<li>A <em>mapping</em> of different variables (columns) in the data table to different,
<em>aesthetics</em> of the plot. Aesthetics are things like
<ul>
<li>the <em>x</em> coordinate,</li>
<li>the <em>y</em> coordinate,</li>
<li>the <em>color</em> of the point or line,</li>
<li>the <em>fill</em> color that is used to fill in areas, like the interior of a
rectangle or circle.</li>
<li>the <em>shape</em> of points (e.g., circle, square, triangle, cross, diamond,
…)</li>
<li>the <em>size</em> of points and lines</li>
<li>the <em>linetype</em> (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted, …)</li>
<li>and so forth …</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A <em>geometry</em> (point, line, box, etc.) that is used to draw the data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A coordinate system (axes and legends)</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some more aspects to the gramar of graphics, but we don’t need them
for what we’re going to do.</p>
<p>These graphics functions are explained in detail in
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html">Chapter 3</a> of
<a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/"><em>R for Data Science</em></a>.</p>
<p>A simple graph has just one layer:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = tidy_zonal, # the data
       # the mapping of variables to aesthetics
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = anomaly, color = latitude, shape = latitude)
       ) +
  geom_point() + # the geometry
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature Anomaly&quot;) # labels for the coordinates</code></pre>
<p><img src="/lab_docs/lab_02_overview_files/figure-html/simple_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can also make a plot with the same data, but two layers:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = tidy_zonal, # the data
       # the mapping of variables to aesthetics
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = anomaly, color = latitude, shape = latitude)
       ) +
  geom_point() + # the geometry of the first layer
  geom_line() +  # the geometry of the second layer
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature Anomaly&quot;) # labels for the coordinates</code></pre>
<p><img src="/lab_docs/lab_02_overview_files/figure-html/second_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can also use different mappings for different layers</p>
<pre class="r"><code>annual_extremes = weather %&gt;% mutate(year = year(date)) %&gt;%
  group_by(location, year) %&gt;% 
  summarize(tmin = min(tmin, na.rm = T),      # the na.rm = T means to ignore 
            tmax = max(tmax, na.rm = T)) %&gt;%  # missing values if we don&#39;t put 
  ungroup()                                   # that in, then  if any year has
                                              # a missing value for even one 
                                              # day, the tmax or tmin for that 
                                              # year will be recorded as  
                                              # NA (missing)

ggplot(annual_extremes,                       # The data
       aes(x = year, color = location) ) +    # Shared aesthetics go here
                                              #
  geom_point(aes(y = tmin, shape = &quot;min&quot;)) +  # Aesthetics that are different 
  geom_point(aes(y = tmax, shape = &quot;max&quot;)) +  # for different geometrries go 
                                              # with the geometry.
                                              # 
  xlim(1990,2000) +                           # Set the range of the x-axis, 
                                              # part of the coordinate 
                                              # specification
                                              # 
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature Anomaly&quot;) # labels for the coordinates</code></pre>
<p><img src="/lab_docs/lab_02_overview_files/figure-html/third_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Note that <code>ggplot</code> issued several harmless warnings to tell us that
setting the limits of the <em>x</em>-axis the way we did cause some points not to be
plotted.
We can tell RMarkdown not to include those warnings in the document by adding
“warning=FALSE” to the options for the chunk</p>
<p>If we want to specify aesthetics as having fixed values, we can specify them
outside of the mapping. Here I specify the size and color of lines:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = annual_extremes) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = tmin, group = location), 
            color = &quot;dark blue&quot;, size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = tmax, group = location), 
            color = &quot;dark red&quot;, size = 0.3) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = tmin, color = location, shape = &quot;min&quot;), 
             size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = tmax, color = location, shape = &quot;max&quot;), 
             size = 2) +
  xlim(1990,2000) + # set the range of the x-axis, 
                    # part of the coordinate specification
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature Anomaly&quot;) # labels for the coordinates</code></pre>
<p><img src="/lab_docs/lab_02_overview_files/figure-html/fourth_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can also take finer control of the axis formatting:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data = annual_extremes) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = tmin, group = location), 
            color = &quot;dark blue&quot;, size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(x = year, y = tmax, group = location), 
            color = &quot;dark red&quot;, size = 0.3) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = tmin, color = location, shape = &quot;min&quot;), 
             size = 2) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = tmax, color = location, shape = &quot;max&quot;), 
             size = 2) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1990,2000), 
                     breaks = c(1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000)) + 
  # ^^^ the &quot;breaks&quot; parameter for an axis tells R where to put the labels
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature Anomaly&quot;) # labels for the coordinates</code></pre>
<p><img src="/lab_docs/lab_02_overview_files/figure-html/fifth_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>And, of course, we could use <code>pivot_longer</code> to simplify this graph:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>annual_extremes_tidy = annual_extremes %&gt;%
  pivot_longer(cols = -c(year, location), names_to = &quot;Temperature&quot;, 
               values_to = &quot;value&quot;)

ggplot(data = annual_extremes_tidy,                   # the data
       aes(x = year, y = value, color = location)) +  # the aesthetics
  geom_line(aes(size = Temperature)) +                # for lines, the size
                                                      # varies with Temperature
  geom_point(aes(shape = Temperature), size = 2) +    # for points, the shape
                                                      # varies with Temperature
  scale_size_manual(values = c(tmax = 0.5, 
                               tmin = 0.1)) + # set coordinates for &quot;size&quot;
  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1990,2000), 
                     breaks = c(1990, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000)) + 
  # ^^^ Set coordinates for the x-axis.
  scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Set1&quot;, name = &quot;City&quot;) + 
  # We can override the default color palette. 
  # The Brewer palettes are very good for people with color-blindness.
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Temperature Anomaly&quot;) # labels for the coordinates</code></pre>
