## Reading:

No new reading for today.

### Notes:

The midterm exam will be a mixture of about 40% multiple-choice questions and 60% free-response short-answer questions.
It will cover all the reading through Wednesday, Feb. 12.

I will provide a sheet with the important numbers (such as the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, the lapse rate of the atmosphere, 
the solar constant, and so forth), and the important equations (such as the Stefan-Boltzmann law, the barometric law, 
and the chemical reactions that control carbon-dioxide buffering in the oceans).

Remember to bring a calculator, \#2 pencils, and an eraser.
