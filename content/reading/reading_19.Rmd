## Reading:

### Required Reading (everyone):

* Web Page: [John Cook, "A History of FLICC: The Five Techniques of Science Denial" (2020)](https://crankyuncle.com/a-history-of-flicc-the-5-techniques-of-science-denial/){target="_blank"}.

### Reading Notes:

We will play a game in class in which we try to spot the fallacies in common talking points by people who try to discredit climate science.

Read this blog by John Cook about the FLICC framework for identifying types of misinformation.

Before you come to class, either install the Cranky Uncle game on your phone or tablet, or connect to it on your browser when you come to class.
