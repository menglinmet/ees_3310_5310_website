<h3>Reading Notes:</h3>
<p>These readings address two important aspects that are neglected in most analyses of climate policy:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Gilligan &amp; Vandenbergh write about the obstacles that partisan polarization and political gridlock pose for
effective action on climate change and offer ideas for how private-sector initiatives can contribute to making
progress even when government remains paralyzed by gridlock. They also introduce a framework for analyzing
the effectiveness of private-sector initiatives as well as government regulatory policy.</li>
<li>Nielsen <em>et al.</em> dig more deeply into the policy-analysis framework from Gilligan &amp; Vandenbergh and suggest
ways that integrated assessment models of climate, energy, and the economy could incorporate more realistic
treatments of human behavior and of the political systems and how these more pragmatic approaches to policy
analysis could improve reports on potential policy responses to climate change.</li>
