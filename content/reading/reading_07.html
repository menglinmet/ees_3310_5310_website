<li>What are the important differences between the layer-model approach to calculating temperature and the skin-model on pp. 45–46?</li>
<li>How does band saturation work? How can you recognize saturation in MODTRAN?</li>
<li>How do you use MODTRAN to calculate the effect of doubling CO<sub>2</sub>?</li>
<li>How do you use the full-spectrum model to calculate the effect of doubling CO<sub>2</sub>?</li>
</ul>
