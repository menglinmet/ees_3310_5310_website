<h1>General Instructions</h1>
<p>In the past three weeks, we focused on mastering many of the basics of using
R and RMarkdown. For this week’s lab, when you write up the answers, I would
like you to think about integrating your R code chunks with your text.</p>
<p>For instance, you can describe what you’re going to do to answer the question,
and then for each step, after you describe what you’re going to do in that
step, you can include an R code chunk to do what you just described, and then
the subsequent text can either discuss the results of what you just did
or describe what the next step of the analysis will do.</p>
<p>This way, your answer can have several small chunks of R code that build on
each other and follow the flow of your text.</p>
<p>For this lab, you will use the RRTM model, which includes both radiation and
convection.</p>
<div id="exercise-1-lapse-rate" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 1: Lapse Rate</h2>
<p>Run the RRTM model in its default configuration and then vary the lapse rate
from 0 to 10 K/km. For each value of the lapse rate, adjust the surface
temperature until the earth loses as much heat as it gains (i.e., the value of
<em>Q</em> in the <code>run_rrtm</code> model output is zero.)</p>
<p>It will probably be easier to do this with the interactive version of the RRTM
model at <a href="http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/" class="uri">http://climatemodels.uchicago.edu/rrtm/</a> than with the R interface
<code>run_rrtm</code>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Make a tibble containing the values of the lapse rate and the corresponding
equilibrium surface temperature, and make a plot with lapse rate on the
horizontal axis and surface temperature on the vertical axis.</p></li>
<li><p>Describe how the equilibrium surface temperature varies as the lapse rate
varies.</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="exercise-1-report" class="section level3">
<h3>Exercise 1 Report:</h3>
<p>I varied the lapse rate from 0 to 10 Kelvin/km in steps of 1 K/km.
At each value of the lapse rate, I manually adjusted the surface temperature in
the interactive RRTM model until the heat budget was balanced (the model
reported that “If the Earth has these properties … then it loses as much
energy as it gains.”).</p>

<p>The figure below shows the results. As the lapse rate increases, the change in
surface temperature becomes smaller and smaller. At the last step,
from 9 to 10 K/km, the surface temperature did not change at all.</p>

<h1>Exercises on Albedo and Clouds</h1>
<p>For the following exercises, start off with the RRTM model in its default
configuration.
Record the ground temperature.
For each part of this exercise you will do the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>You will adjust the albedo or the clouds.</p></li>
<li><p>You will compare the visible and longwave radiation going down through the
atmosphere to the surface and also the visible and longwave radiation
going up from the surface, through the atmosphere, to space.</p>
<p>The results of an RRTM model run have a tibble called <code>fluxes</code> with columns
for <code>altitude</code>, <code>sw_down</code>, <code>sw_up</code>, <code>lw_down</code>, <code>lw_up</code>, <code>total_down</code>, and
<code>total_up</code>, where <code>sw</code> means shortwave, <code>lw</code> means longwave, and <code>total</code>
is the sum of shortwave plus longwave.</p>
<p>The first row of this tibble is at ground-level and the last row
is at the top of the atmosphere.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>default_data = run_rrtm()
fluxes = default_data$fluxes
surface_fluxes = head(fluxes, 1) # get the first row
space_fluxes = tail(fluxes, 1)   # get the last row</code></pre></li>
<li><p>You will adjust the ground temperature until the heat coming in balances
the heat going out (the model will say,
“If the Earth has these properties … then it loses as much energy as it
gains.”</p></li>
</ol>
<div id="exercise-2-the-urban-heat-island" class="section level2">
<h2>Exercise 2: The urban heat island</h2>
<p>First, run the RRTM model in its default configuration and note the surface
temperature and the albedo.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Change the surface type from “Earth’s average” to “Asphalt” (don’t change
the surface temperature until the instructions tell you to) and describe
the changes in the local climate:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the albedo?</li>
<li>Report the changes in shortwave and longwave light absorbed by
the surface and going out to space.</li>
<li>How much does the total balance of heat change (i.e., how many W/m<sup>2</sup> does
the Earth lose or gain)?</li>
<li>Now, adjust the ground temperature until the Earth loses as much energy as
it gains.</li>
<li>What is the new surface temperature?
How does it compare to the surface temperature in the default
configuration?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Change the surface albedo to “Concrete”. Answer the same questions as in part
(a).</p></li>
<li><p>In cities, streets and parking lots are usually paved with asphalt.
Roofs of houses and other buildings are often covered with asphalt shingles
or black rubber-like compounds.</p>
<p>The results you got in this exercise represent covering <em>the entire planet</em>
with asphalt or concrete, so they are far more extreme than you would get
from only covering <em>part of a city</em> with one material or the other, but
the general principle holds and in a city you would have much smaller
changes, but they would be in the same direction as you found here.</p>
<p>How would the choice of using asphalt for roads, parking lots, and roofs in
a large city affect the local climate in the city?
Would using low-albedo materials, such as concrete for streets and parking
lots and light-colored polymers for the roofs of buildings have a benefit
for the people living in the city?</p></li>

<h3>Exercise 2 Report:</h3>
<div id="preliminaries" class="section level4">
<h4><strong>Preliminaries</strong></h4>
<p>Because I will be doing a lot of comparisons here, I want to automate some of
the text using a <code>compare</code> function:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>compare = function(x, y) {
   ifelse(x &gt; y, &quot;greater than&quot;, 
          ifelse(x &lt; y, &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;the same as&quot;))
}

# This function compares two values and prints the absolute value of 
# the difference followed by optional units (e.g., W/m^2^), and then the
# comparison string, so something like &quot;3.2 W/m^2^ less than&quot;.
#
# If the two values are the same, we don&#39;t want to print 
# &quot;0 W/m^2^ the same as&quot;, so we suppress printing the number and the units 
# in that case.
compare_val = function(x, y, digits, units = NULL) {
   delta = format_md(abs(x - y), digits = digits)
   comp_str = compare(x, y)
   ifelse(x == y, comp_str, str_c(delta, units, comp_str, sep = &quot; &quot;))
}</code></pre>
<p>First, I recorded the albedo, surface temperature, and heat fluxes in and out
of the earth under the default conditions of the earth’s average albedo.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>default = run_rrtm()
albedo_default = default$albedo
T_surface_default = default$T_surface

I_in_default = default$i_in
I_out_default = default$i_out

flux_surf_default = default$fluxes %&gt;% filter(altitude == 0)
flux_space_default = tail(default$fluxes, 1)

I_surf_long_default = flux_surf_default$lw_down
I_surf_short_default = flux_surf_default$sw_down
I_space_long_default = flux_space_default$lw_up
I_space_short_default = flux_space_default$sw_up</code></pre>
<p>The albedo was
0.3,
I<sub>in</sub> = 245. W/m<sup>2</sup>, and
I<sub>out</sub> = 245. W/m<sup>2</sup>, so the heat
budget is balanced.</p>
<p>Breaking down the heat flow into shortwave and longwave components, the
heat absorbed by the ground consisted of
281. W/m<sup>2</sup> of longwave radiation and
266. W/m<sup>2</sup> of shortwwave radiation.
The heat radiated out to space consisted of
245. W/m<sup>2</sup> of longwave radiation and
95.2 W/m<sup>2</sup> of shortwwave radiation.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-asphalt-surface" class="section level4">
<h4>2(a) <strong>Asphalt Surface</strong></h4>
<p>Next, I changed the surface type to “Asphalt” and recorded the changes in
albedo, I<sub>in</sub>, I<sub>out</sub>, and heat balance.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>asphalt = run_rrtm(surface_type = &quot;Asphalt&quot;)
albedo_asphalt = asphalt$albedo

I_in_asphalt = asphalt$i_in
I_out_asphalt = asphalt$i_out

# This is the net heat flow into the earth.
# It should be zero when heat in = heat out
Q_asphalt = asphalt$Q

flux_surf_asphalt = asphalt$fluxes %&gt;% filter(altitude == 0)
flux_space_asphalt = tail(asphalt$fluxes, 1)

I_surf_long_asphalt = flux_surf_asphalt$lw_down
I_surf_short_asphalt = flux_surf_asphalt$sw_down
I_space_long_asphalt = flux_space_asphalt$lw_up
I_space_short_asphalt = flux_space_asphalt$sw_up

Delta_I_in_asphalt = I_in_asphalt - I_in_default
Delta_I_out_asphalt = I_out_asphalt - I_out_default

Delta_I_surf_long_asphalt = I_surf_long_asphalt - I_surf_long_default
Delta_I_surf_short_asphalt = I_surf_short_asphalt - I_surf_short_default
Delta_I_space_long_asphalt = I_space_long_asphalt - I_space_long_default
Delta_I_space_short_asphalt = I_space_short_asphalt - I_space_short_default</code></pre>
<p>The albedo for asphalt is 0.08,
which is a good deal less than the default
albedo.
This caused I<sub>in</sub> to increase from
245. W/m<sup>2</sup> to
297. W/m<sup>2</sup>.
I<sub>out</sub> did not change and remained at
245. W/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Breaking down the heat flow into shortwave and longwave components, the
heat absorbed by the ground consisted of
281. W/m<sup>2</sup> of longwave radiation,
which was
the same as
in the default case, and
262. W/m<sup>2</sup> of shortwwave radiation,
which was
4. W/m<sup>2</sup> less than
in the default case.</p>
<p>The heat radiated out to space consisted of
245. W/m<sup>2</sup> of longwave radiation,
which was
the same as
in the default case, and
43. W/m<sup>2</sup> of shortwwave radiation,
which was
52. W/m<sup>2</sup> less than
in the default case.</p>
<p>Then I opened the interactive RRTM model, set the surface type to “Asphalt,”
and manually adjusted the surface temperature until the heat budget was
balanced.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>T_surface_asphalt = 325.6

# Check that the heat really does balance
asphalt_warming = run_rrtm(surface_type = &quot;Asphalt&quot;, 
                           T_surface = T_surface_asphalt)
Q_asphalt_warmed = asphalt_warming$Q
Delta_T_asphalt = T_surface_asphalt - T_surface_default</code></pre>
<p>The change in I<sub>in</sub> caused a heat-budget imbalance of
52. W/m<sup>2</sup> going
into the Earth.
To put the heat budget back into balance,
I had to raise the surface temperature
from 284. K to
326. K, a change of
41. K.</p>
</div>
<div id="b-concrete-surface" class="section level4">
<h4>2(b) <strong>Concrete Surface</strong></h4>
<p>Next, I did the same for a concrete surface:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>concrete = run_rrtm(surface_type = &quot;Concrete&quot;)
albedo_concrete = concrete$albedo

I_in_concrete = concrete$i_in
I_out_concrete = concrete$i_out

Q_concrete = concrete$Q

flux_surf_concrete = concrete$fluxes %&gt;% filter(altitude == 0)
flux_space_concrete = tail(concrete$fluxes, 1)

I_surf_long_concrete = flux_surf_concrete$lw_down
I_surf_short_concrete = flux_surf_concrete$sw_down
I_space_long_concrete = flux_space_concrete$lw_up
I_space_short_concrete = flux_space_concrete$sw_up

Delta_I_in_concrete = I_in_concrete - I_in_default
Delta_I_out_concrete = I_out_concrete - I_out_default

Delta_I_surf_long_concrete = I_surf_long_concrete - I_surf_long_default
Delta_I_surf_short_concrete = I_surf_short_concrete - I_surf_short_default
Delta_I_space_long_concrete = I_space_long_concrete - I_space_long_default
Delta_I_space_short_concrete = I_space_short_concrete - I_space_short_default</code></pre>
<p>Where asphalt had a much higher albedo albedo for concrete is
0.6 and this
caused I<sub>in</sub> to decrease to
184. W/m<sup>2</sup>.
I<sub>out</sub> did not change and remained at
245. W/m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>Breaking down the heat flow into shortwave and longwave components, the
heat absorbed by the ground consisted of
281. W/m<sup>2</sup> of longwave radiation,
which was
the same as
in the default case, and
271. W/m<sup>2</sup> of shortwwave radiation,
which was
5. W/m<sup>2</sup> greater than
in the default case.</p>
<p>The heat radiated out to space consisted of
245. W/m<sup>2</sup> of longwave radiation,
which was
the same as
in the default case, and
156. W/m<sup>2</sup> of shortwwave radiation,
which was
61. W/m<sup>2</sup> greater than
in the default case.</p>
<p>Then I manually adjusted the surface temperature in the interactive RRTM model
until the heat out balanced the heat in.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>T_surface_concrete = 247.0

# Check that the heat really does balance
concrete_warming = run_rrtm(surface_type = &quot;Concrete&quot;, 
                           T_surface = T_surface_concrete)
Q_concrete_warmed = concrete_warming$Q
Delta_T_concrete = T_surface_concrete - T_surface_default</code></pre>
<p>The change in I<sub>in</sub> caused a heat-budget imbalance of
-61. W/m<sup>2</sup> going
out of the Earth.
To put the heat budget back into balance,
I had to lower the surface temperature to
247. K, a change of
-37. K.</p>
</div>
<div id="c-discussion" class="section level4">
<h4>2(c) <strong>Discussion</strong></h4>
<p>Covering the earth in asphalt caused the planet to warm up by
41. K,
so we could expect that covering
a large part of a city in asphalt or similarly dark-colored material would
cause the city’s temperature to rise.
Conversely, covering the planet in concrete caused it to cool off by
37. K, so replacing asphalt with
concrete in a city would cool the city off a good deal.
This would provide cooler temperature for the people living in the city and
would reduce the impact of global climate change.</p>

<p>The change in I<sub>in</sub> caused a heat-budget imbalance of
0 W/m<sup>2</sup> going
out of the Earth.
To put the heat budget back into balance,
I had to raise the surface temperature

298. K, a change of
14. K.</p>

<p>We can see that for the low clouds, the biggest changes are in the downward
flow of radiation. Downward longwave radiation is a lot greater below the clouds
and downward shortwave is smaller. Above the clouds, there is a small increase
in upward longwave and shortwave, but the changes are much smaller than for the
downward radiation.</p>

<p>At the height of the clouds we can see big changes in the upward radiation:
Outgoing longwave radiation is considerably smaller above the clouds and
outgoing shortwave is larger. There are changes to the downward radiation
at the height of the clouds, but these changes are much smaller than for the
upward radiation.</p>
<p>As these figures show, the low clouds had the greatest effect on
downward radiation and the high clouds had the greatest effect on upward
radiation. In both cases, the clouds affected the longwave radiation much more
than the shortwave.</p>
