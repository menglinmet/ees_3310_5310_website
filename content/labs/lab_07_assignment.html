<div id="overview" class="section level1">
<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>This week, you will start an independent lab project where you will spend a
couple of weeks developing an independent project to look at a new question
about climate science. This question can involve looking more deeply into
something that you studied in a previous lab, or it can be something new.</p>
<p>For this week, your assignment is to propose an independent project.
<strong>Your proposal will be due Wednesday, March 16 by the end of the day,
on Brightspace.</strong>
The proposal only needs to be a couple of paragraphs describing what you want
to study and what kinds of data (model output, or archived climate data that
you will download from the internet).</p>
<p>Lab on Monday March 14 will be used to discuss possible project topics and
Mr.Â Belanger and I will be available to give you feedback and help you think
about where you will get data to carry out the project.</p>
