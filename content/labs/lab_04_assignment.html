<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>This lab will explore the role of convection (the vertical motion of air) in the atmosphere, clouds, and their effects on climate.</p>
<p>Three things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Because of a mixup on my part, I inadvertently briefly made the answers
available, so to keep things fair for everyone, I have posted my answers for
everyone to see.</li>
<li>Because of the in-class reading days on Feb. 23–24, I did not want to make
this lab due during or right before or after those reading days, so it will
be due Monday March 1. Lab 5 will also be due Mar 1., so you will have to get
them both in by then, but between the answers being available and the extra
week for this lab, I hope this will give you a lot more flexibility in getting
the assignments done.</li>
<li>One big piece of this lab is to use RMarkdown to write a report that really
integrates text with code and graphics and tables that are generated by
RMarkdown. Use the fact that you can easily check your answers to the specific
questions to give you some freedom to think about how you want to present your
answers. Don’t just copy and paste from my answers, but think about how you
would use RMarkdown to present your answers in your own way.</li>
