<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>This lab will explore the role of convection (the vertical motion of air) in the
atmosphere, clouds, and their effects on climate.</p>
<p>Something too note:</p>
<ul>
<li>One big piece of this lab is to use RMarkdown to write a report that really
integrates text with code and graphics and tables that are generated by
RMarkdown. Use the fact that you can easily check your answers to the specific
questions to give you some freedom to think about how you want to present your
answers. Donâ€™t just copy and paste from my answers, but think about how you
would use RMarkdown to present your answers in your own way.</li>
