# Overview:

This lab will introduce working with climate data using R and RMarkdown. We will download temperature and CO~2~ measurements from scientific archives of climate data and practice producing tables of measurements, making plots of the measurements, and analyzing the series of measurements to determine the trends over time (rates of increase or decrease).
