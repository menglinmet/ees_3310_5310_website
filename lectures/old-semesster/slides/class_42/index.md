# Final Exam {.center}

## Final Exam {.center}

* Posted to Brightspace
* Due 2:00 PM, May 10
* Turn it in on Brightspace
  * Take-Home Final Exam assignment
* 2 essay questions
* Open book, notes, etc.

# Questions and Discussion {#questions-sec .center}

## Questions and Discussion {#questions}

* Questions you have about climate change
  * Science
  * Technology
  * Policy
* Thoughts and Discussion:
  * About what we've read
  * About what the future of climate holds
  * About policy options

# Reviewing the Semester {.center}

* What do we know? (Science)
* What can we do? (Technology, Policy)
* How can we decide? (Politics, Ethics)

# What Do We Know? {.center}

## What Do We Know for Sure?

* Human activity is raising CO~2~ to the highest levels in 
  more than 800,000 years
* The planet is rapidly warming
* The greenhouse effect is well-established science
* Rising levels of CO~2~ make oceans acidic

## What Do We Know Very Confidently?

* Human activity is responsible for most observed warming
* CO~2~ levels will remain high for thousands of years after we
  stop burning fossil fuels
* Even if CO~2~ stops rising, temperature and sea level will continue to change
  for centuries

## What Do We Know With Some Uncertainty?

* The planet will warm around 3&deg;C for every doubling of CO~2~
* Sea-level will rise 1--2 meters this century
* Extreme heat waves will become much more common
* Drought will become more common in much of the world

## What Do We Not Know<br/>(Much Uncertainty)?

* Regional responses to climate change (e.g., Tennessee)
* Details about drought, rain, floods, etc.
* Tipping points for catastrophe (runaway sea-level rise,
  runaway methane releases, ...)
* Severe storms (hurricanes, tornadoes, ...)
* Impacts on agriculture

# What Can We Do? {.center}

## What Can We Do?

* Mitigate Warming:
    * Efficiency (less energy)
    * Clean energy
        * Nuclear
        * Solar
        * Wind
        * ...
* Adaptation
* Geoengineering

## How Can We Do it?

* "Top-Down" Policy:
    * Use science to choose temperature goal
    * Temperature &rarr; GHG concentration
    * GHG concentration &rarr; emissions
    * Emissions &rarr; clean energy requirements
* "Bottom-Up" Policy:
    * What measures are most practical?
    * How can we combine them into coherent policy?

# How Can We Decide? {.center}

## Problems for Politics

* Dangers are serious, uncertain, and irreversible
* Climate change is not the only danger
    * How do we set priorities?
    * What principles to use?
        * Maximize expected utility
        * Insurance approach
        * Social justice
* Emissions are today, most damage is far in the future
    * How to balance needs & capabilities of current and future generations?
