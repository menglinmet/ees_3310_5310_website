## The Cranky Uncle Game

* Open the game on your phone or at 
  <https://app.crankyuncle.info/home>
* Log in with group code VUCLIM
* Don't opt in to take the research quiz at this time
  * It will take about 10 minutes at the start and 10 more minutes at the end.
* {+} Take 20 minutes to play that game on your own.
  * {+} When you finish the first five causes of misinformation, then it will 
    unlock the detailed questions about logical fallacies, cherry picking, 
    and conspiracy theories
  * {+} Can you think of examples you have heard from other people of climate
    misinformation using these patterns?
  * {+} If something seems confusing and you would like me to explain, 
    ask in the chat or unmute and speak up
* {+} After 20 minutes of play, we'll break out into rooms to discuss the different
  kinds of misinformation, then come back for a group discussion.
