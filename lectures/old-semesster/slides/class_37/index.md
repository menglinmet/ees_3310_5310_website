## Feasibiliity of Direct Air-Capture{#air-capture-feasibility}

* {+} Possible in principle
* {+} Hasn't been tried on large scale
* {+} Very expensive
* {+} Why it's not hopeless:
  * {+} National Academy Estimates: $90--600/ton
  * {+} Capture from smokestack uses 30% of energy from power plant
  * {+} CO~2~ in air is 300 times more dilute
    * {+} Doesn't take 300 times more energy
    * {+} Takes 1.5--3.4 times as much

## Bioenergy with<br/>Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) {#beccs-costs}

* {+} Biomass production for fuel is already in wide use
* {+} Carbon capture is not currently used, but would be three times as 
  energy-efficient as direct air capture.
* {+} Estimated costs:
  * {+} For power plants: $70/ton
  * {+} For vehicles: $40--130/ton
* {+} Concerns about impact of converting so much land to energy production.

## Cost of Air Capture {#cost-discussion}

* {+} Cost to capture all human emission:
  * At $140/metric ton CO~2~:
    * $6--8 trillion: 10--15% of world GDP
  * At $27/metric ton CO~2~:
    * $1.2--1.5 trillion: 2--3% of world GDP
* {+} Is it worth it?
  * {+} Stern: "If mitigation costs 1% of world GDP by 2100 ... this is equivalent to
    growth rate dropping from 2.50% to 2.49%"
  * {+} GDP in 2100 would still be 950% greater than today.

## Air-Capture as Technological Fix {#air-capture-tech-fix .center}

1. {+} Cause-Effect Relationship?
   * {+} Yes: Removing CO~2~ would cancel adding CO~2~
2. {+} Assessable Effects?
   * {+} Yes: We can measure CO~2~ concentrations<br/>(almost 70 years experience)
3. {+} Established technological base?
   * {+} Laboratory projects to build on
   * {+} Challenge is scaling up
4. {+} What's missing?
   * {+} Where to store CO~2~ after we capture it?

## Scaling Up {#scaling-up .eighty}

> An apparatus the size of a semi trailer could remove a ton of carbon dioxide
> per day, or 365 tons a year.

. . .

> The world's cars, planes, refineries, and power plants now produce about 
> thirty six billion tons of CO~2~ annually, so ...

. . .

> ... if you built a hundred million trailer-size units you could actually keep
> up with current emissions.

You might say it's against my self-interest to say it,<br/>
but I think that, in the near-term, talking about carbon removal is silly,<br/>
because it almost certainly is cheaper to cut emissions now<br/>
than to do large-scale carbon removal.

The punch line is, it doesn't matter. We actually need to do direct air capture,<br/>
so we need to create technologies to do that. 
Whether it's smart or not,<br/>
whether it's optimized or not, whether it's the
lowest-cost pathway or not,<br/>
we know we need to do it.
