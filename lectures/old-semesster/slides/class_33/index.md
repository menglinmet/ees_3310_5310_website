# Overview {.center}

## Barker's Critique {.eighty}

1. The global economy is a complex, nonlinear dynamic system undergoing
   technological change.

2. {+} Intergenerational responsibilities are an ethical problem.

   Traditional economics tacitly adopt an extreme form of utilitarianism.<br/>
   Other ethical perspectives should also be considered.

3. {+} Traditional economics assumes _continuity_ and _path independence_.

   Both history and engineering point to _discontinuities_ and _path dependence_.

4. {+} Traditional economics assumes a mathematical _social welfare function_ that
   ignores the realities of the political process: 
   * negotiation, 
   * fragile and unstable alliances, 
   * the role of parties, 
   * etc.

## Traditional vs. New Economics {.eighty}

* Assumptions of traditional economics:
  * Individual preferences are fixed
  * Utilities can be added up and aggregated into a single dollar value
  * Technological innovation is not affected by climate policies
* {+} Key policy messages from traditional economics:
  1. Use a carbon tax that starts small and then grows steadily
  2. It's better to wait than to act now because:
     * Technology will reduce the costs of cutting emissions.
     * Economic growth will mean more money for cutting emissions in the future.
* {+} "New economics":
  * Preferences are malleable
  * Many important values cannot be translated to dollars
  * Technological innovation is affected by policy choices
* {+} Key policy messages from new economics:
  1. "The benefits of strong early action far outweigh the economic costs of
     not acting" --- N. Stern
  2. The focus should be on managing risk, not seeking definite returns on 
     investments.

# Uncertainty

* Cost-benefit analysis (traditional econ) focuses on maximizing the expected
  or average net benefits
* {+} We don't buy insurance to maximize the average benefits, but to pay a manageable
  cost (premium) in order to avoid unmanageable costs (house burns down)
* {+} Martin Weitzman's Dismal Theorem:
  * Even if there is only a one in a million chance that climate change would
    end civilization, the cost would be practically infinite, so it would be
    worth spending an enormous amount to avoid that possibility
  * {+} Similar concern: A giant asteroid hitting the earth
    * Effective asteroid detection and defense would cost a few billion dollars
    * Government has spent around $650 million

## Path Dependence, Economics, and Technology

* Ideal: If you develop a better product for a lower price, 
  <br/>it will dominate the market
* {+} Complications:
  * {+} Network effects:
    * {+} One cell phone is not much good.
      * Need a network of people to call
    * {+} Hydrogen vs. electric, vs. gasoline cars: 
      * Cars need filling/charging stations,
      * Filling/charging stations need cars.
    * {+} Similarly, VCR/DVD/etc.: 
      * Players need movies, 
      * Movies need players
  * {+} Familiarity: QWERTY keyboards &rarr; lock-in
* {+} Which technology is widely adopted depends on historical path

## Ethics and Social Choice

* Traditional economics seeks to maximize the value of some 
  <br/>_social welfare function_.
* {+} But this does not address distribution of costs and benefits:
  * Poor nations suffer the most from climate change but did the least to
    cause it.
* {+} Different people and different groups of people have different values:
  * no single function can account for the different priorities and 
    preferences
* {+} Values and preferences change over time:
  * Future generations may have very different preferences and priorities than
    we have.
    * But our actions force choices on them.

## The Value of Non-Market Goods

> [Five meters of sea-level rise] is something that should rather be avoided.
> <br/>--- R. Tol

> The reason we should "rather avoid" drowning the coastal cities of the world
> is not primarily that this would reduce global GDP, but that drowning those
> cities would be a dreadful act of barbarism
> <br/>--- C. Jaeger _et al_.
