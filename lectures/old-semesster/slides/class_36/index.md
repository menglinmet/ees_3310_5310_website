# Geoengineering {#intro-geoengineering-sec .center}

## Scope of Problem {#scope-of-problem .ninety}

* {+} After 10,000 years:
  * {+} High-level nuclear waste: about 0.03% of<br/>excess radioactivity remains
  * {+} CO~2~: about 25% remains in atmosphere<br/>(for release of 4,000--5,000 GTC)
* {+} Consequences uncertain
  * {+} Possible catastrophic consequences lasting thousands of years
  * {+} Experts think "business as usual" has high probability (>50%) of tipping point to disaster
* {+} Eliminating fossil fuels quickly looks very challenging, expensive

## Comparing imperfect solutions {#imperfect-solutions .center}

* Mitigation:
  * Cut emissions
  * Geoengineering
* Adaptation
  * Manageable, unmanageable, and unmanaged systems
* Do nothing

>  "We have three options:<br/>mitigation, adaptation,
>  and suffering."<br/>
>  --- Prof. Lonnie Thompson

# Defining Geoengineering {#definition-sec .center}

## Defining Geoengineering {#definition}

* {+} Scale and Intent
  * {+} Intent without scale: *ornamental gardening*
  * {+} Scale without intent: *pollution, global warming*
  * {+} **Scale with intent: geoengineering**

## Basic Concepts {#basic-concepts .eighty}

* {+} Wicked problem
* {+} Technological fix
* {+} Geoengineering:
  * {+} Albedo engineering
    * {+} Pielke: Doesn't work as technological fix
    * {+} Nordhaus:
      * {+} Reflecting 2% of sunlight cancels doubling CO~2~
      * {+} Costs 1-10% as much as reducing emissions
      * {+} "Fire truck" vs. "Fire insurance"
      * {+} "Salvage therapy"
  * {+} Air capture of CO~2~
    * {+} Pielke: Worth considering
  * {+} Nordhaus:
    * {+} All geoengineering poses a moral hazard problem

## Criteria for Technological Fix {#tech-fix}

#. {+} Cause-effect relationship
   * {+} Can it work in theory?
#. {+} Assessable effects
   * {+} Can we tell whether it's working?
#. {+} Established technological base
   * {+} Research and development needs somewhere to start
   * {+} Beginning from scratch takes too long to be useful.
   * {+} Focus on incremental improvements
   * {+} Don't bet on big breakthroughs

## It's not just about<br/>global average temperature {#more-than-temperature .eighty}

::: {.mtop-3}
* {+} Can geoengineering manage all parts of the planet at once?
* {+} Can we manage both temperature and precipitation?
* {+} What about other effects of CO~2~?
  * {+} Ocean acidification?
* {+} However...
  * It looks likely that it could reduce the harm from climate change.
    * Can't return planet to pre-industrial climate, but:
      * Can probably _reduce changes_ in both temperature and precipitation
      * Can probably _reduce changes_ across the whole planet
      * The same climate models we use to study climate change say SRM should
        work

[THE LEGAL ASPECTS OF RAINMAKING]{style="text-align:center;color:black;"}

Since the first successful experiments in the laboratories of the 
General Electric Company in 1946, the artificial precipitation of rain and snow 
has become a reality. The method developed by such experiments involves the use 
of dry ice and similar cooling materials.</p>

[LEGAL REMEDIES FOR "CLOUD-SEEDING ACTIVITIES"]{style="text-align:center;color:black;"}

The important question of liability for "cloud seeding" has been decided at the 
appellate-court level for the first time. The decision,  
_Southwest Weather Research, Inc. v. Duncan_, 
attains added significance in that it delineates the landowner's rights in the 
rain clouds above his land and circumscribes the applicable remedy.

**In North Carolina, hurricanes did what scientists could not: Convince 
Republicans that climate change is real**

"I always thought climate change was a bunch of nonsense, but now I really do 
think it is happening," said [Margie] White, a 65-year-old Trump supporter.

... the consensus among scientists is that the effects of climate change ... 
made these torms far more destructive.

... the key thing, then is that all of the weather that is occurring, all of 
the storms are occurring in an environment that is simply different than it 
used to be.

* Most scientific reviews on link between climate change and extreme weather 
  are inconclusive
* But public, media jump to conclusions
* Will they also blame geoengineering?

# Summary {#summary-sec .center}

## Summary {#summary}

* Is Solar-Radiation Management a Feasible Technological Fix?
  * {+} Pielke says no
    * {+} Relation between cause and effect is complex and uncertain
    * {+} Can't assess the effects without a full-scale global experiment
    * {+} Doesn't build off existing technology
  * {+} Others say maybe
    * {+} It can't cancel out global warming, but it could make it much less bad.
    * {+} It's quickly reversible so we could adjust as we learn more
    * {+} It doesn't need fancy technology.
  * {+} Many problems are more political than scientific: 
    * How should decisions about geoengineering be made?
    * Who should participate in decision-making?
